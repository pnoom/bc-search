"2001/090","Trotter","Uganda","Charles Trotter collection","Charles Trotter was born in Scotland in 1923, but at the age of three months he and his mother Margaret returned home to Uganda, where his father James worked in the Land and Surveys Department. With a break for war service, James had been with the same department in Uganda since graduating from Cambridge in 1912. Margaret (nee Duncan) had gone out to Kenya as a Post Office clerk in 1918, and was later transferred to Entebbe, where she met James. They were married in 1921.

For the first 6 years of his life, Charles accompanied his parents on a near-permanent safari owing to the itinerant nature of his father's work. The family mixed almost exclusively within the British colonial community where they enjoyed a busy social life, captured by Margaret who was a keen photographer. In 1929 he returned to the UK to attend boarding school, before becoming a professional photographer. He returned to East Africa on the SS Kenya's maiden voyage in 1951 at the age of 28, capturing life on board ship as the first assignment of this phase of his career. He made Nairobi his home for the following 11 years, during which he established himself as a leading photographer of British-Kenyan high society, royal and ceremonial events, industry, safari, sporting fixtures and landscapes, travelling extensively around East Africa. One of his great passions was motorsport, and he was for some years the official photographer of the East African Safari Rally. He also photographed numerous celebrities, including singers and Hollywood actors, who travelled to Kenya, as well as Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their tour of Kenya in 1952.

Charles Trotter represented Kenya in pistol shooting at the Olympics in both 1956 and 1960. In 1962, a year before independence, he returned to the UK, where he died in 2003. He had recorded an oral history interview with the Museum in 2002 (no. 948).

The material in this collection divides into two main series: work created by Charles Trotter during his photographic career (1948 - 1962) and photographs taken by his parents (predominantly his mother Margaret) prior to 1937 when the family are believed to have returned to the UK. Charles's collection of c. 50,000 negatives are a particularly rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to independence - its landscapes, cities, people, society and industries.  Although currently in a poor state of conservation, many of the images are accessible through the large number of prints which form part of this collection. 

The Trotter family photographs form a fascinating contrast by encapsulating life for a British family in East Africa a generation earlier. They give a particular insight into the opportunities and lifestyle available to Margaret Trotter as a young woman in Africa, and the existence of many of her negatives as well as album prints would enable further study into her recording of this part of her life.

"2001/090/1","Trotter","Congo","Charles Trotter - photographic work","After returning to East Africa in his late 20s, Charles Trotter achieved considerable success as a photographer between 1951 and 1962, launching his career with pictures of the voyage out on the maiden voyage of the SS Kenya. Based in Nairobi, his work covered a huge variety of subjects for which he received commissions, such as weddings, family portraits and society occasions (chiefly among the British community), commercial commissions showing industries of the time, and public occasions such as sporting and cultural events and royal visits. There are also a huge number of images which represent his own interests, including African landscapes and wildlife and local people. The majority of the images are taken in Kenya, although other East African countries including Zanzibar, Tanzania and Uganda are also represented. His reputation is demonstrated by his presence behind the scenes at royal visits and on the sets of Hollywood films. The particular research value of the collection lies in the fact that many of the pictures capture the end of Kenya as a colony, and the new roads, civic buildings and factories photographed by Trotter suggest the pride which accompanied independence.

Areas of particular focus and interest include:
 - motorsport, with images from the East African Safari Rally for which Trotter was the official photographer
 - other sporting events, including horse shows, athletics meets and the Kenyan Team at the Melbourne (1956) and Rome (1960) Olympics
- the 1950s expansion of Nairobi, with its large number of new buildings constructed in an attempt to represent a departure from its colonial origins
 - aerial photography of the Kenyan landscape
 - film stills and film stars visiting Kenya on location, including Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable
 - royal visits, including Princess Elizabeth on the visit where she became Queen in 1952 and the Queen Mother in 1959
 - scenes connected to the Mau Mau emergency

The material in this collection includes the complete set of over 50,000 negatives from Trotter's career, together with complete indexes to the images. There are also over 2000 loose prints, 3 albums and c. 150 enlargements taken from the negative collection, as well as c. 330 slides and a film for which Trotter was cameraman.","1948 - 1962","51 boxes, 1 film","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/1/1","Trotter","Kenya","Negatives","This collection of c. 50,000 negatives represents the entire output of Charles Trotter's photographic studio in the 1950s, covering a huge variety of themes from wedding and family portraits to industrial photographs, political events and wild animals. Each negative is numbered chronologically and listed, with dates and brief notes, in the accompanying series of negative books (2001/090/1/2), which also contains a subject index. Although Trotter started recording his negatives in 1948, our sequence starts in 1951 around the time he arrived in Kenya and set up his photographic business.","1951-1962","34 boxes","UNFIT FOR PRODUCTION. This series consists of c. 50,000 cellulose acetate Ilford negatives stored in individual numbered sleeves. The majority are 4.75 x 3.75 inch with a sizeable minority being 2.25 x 2.25 inch. Many are in an advanced state of acetate degradation, with the emulsion shrinking away from the acetate base resulting in image loss, and off-gassing occurring. Prior to purchase by BECM, these negatives were analysed by conservation staff at BMAG and at the V&A, and by Ilford Ltd. The state of their deterioration, possibly hastened by their origin in a hot climate, is extreme, and urgent action is required to preserve those images which remain.","default","default","default"

"2001/090/1/3","Trotter","Kenya","Loose Prints","The c. 2100 prints in this series span the entire period which Charles Trotter spent working as a commercial photographer in Kenya. No evidence exists as to why these prints were created or retained, whether they were kept because they reflect some of Trotter's particular interests or whether they are simply all that remain of a larger set.  

The boxes in which the prints were stored cover a defined set of themes, namely the maiden voyage of the SS Kenya, African people, aerial photos, scenery, Mt. Kilimanjaro, wild animals, dhows and views in the East African cities and countryside. There are a small number of more miscellaneous prints including images of motor racing, one of Trotter's passions. Many of the themes and assignments covered by Trotter and represented in his vast negative collection, including images of the White British community in Kenya, do not feature here. They are a particularly rich resource for images of the Kenyan countryside and animals, pre-independence Nairobi and royal visits.","1951 - 1962","8 boxes","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/1/3/10","Trotter","Zanzibar","Catalogued prints","The prints in this large series are mainly believed to be part of the same larger series as the files of boxed prints in 2001/090/1/3/1-9. An apparently ""missing"" 5 boxes originally contained prints of the SS Kenya, Nairobi and Wild Animals (3 boxes), which overlaps with the subjects of the majority of the photographs here, although other pictures, such as a number of aerial views, have also ended up in this section.

Part 1, contained in a file, consists of a small set of photographs which are mainly believed to have originated in 2001/090/1/3/1-9. These include two images of Jomo Kenyatta on his release from jail in September 1961, two images of dhows which were probably originally part of 2001/090/1/3/8, two images taken during Princess Margaret's visit to Kenya in October 1956, Chuka drummers at the Royal Agricultural Show (these last 3 possibly originally from 2001/090/1/3/2-3), some boy scouts marching and a picture of Maasai tribesmen with Trotter's camera which has a duplicate in part 2 below and a duplicate and companion image at 2001/090/1/5/1/41&42. There are also 2 pictures of motor racing events, taken in 1957 and 1959 respectively, which are larger than the other pictures and appear to have originally been part of a different series again.

Part 2 predominantly contains pictures taken on the S.S. Kenya's maiden voyage in late summer 1951. This is a much more complete set than that found in 2001/090/1/3/1, and contains many additional images as well as a number which are duplicated there. The photographs include views of and from the ship and also document all aspects of onboard life, including entertainments, parties, passengers and crew, and facilities such as the swimming pool. There are also views of destinations passed or called at en route including Gibraltar, Algiers, Port Said, Port Sudan and Mombasa. There are several copies of some of the images. At the beginning of the box are a small number of prints which have possibly been misplaced from elsewhere in the prints collection: these include pictures of wild animals, local people, events during the Queen Mother's 1959 visit to Kenya and an image of Masai tribesmen with Trotter's camera.

Part 3 contains images of East African towns and countryside. Some of the images of landscapes are similar to those contained in 2001/090/1/3/5 and 2001/090/1/3/9, and there may be some duplicates. The series starts with images of Nairobi, but also includes views of Arusha (clock tower), Eldoret, Mombasa (port area with the SS Durban Castle and SS Kenya and Shelly Beach Hotel), Malindi, Gedi, Kampala (Makerere College), Mpanda Airport in Tanzania and Zanzibar. The images of Nairobi are particularly striking in that they mainly depict modern architecture and new buildings constructed in the run up to independence, some of them at varying stages of construction. The buildings featured include the Parliament Building, City Hall, King George VI Hospital, St Andrews Presbyterian Church, New Stanley Hotel, New Technical College, the YWCA swimming pool and Embakazi Airport as well as older buildings such as the National Bank and old New Stanley Hotel building,  A number of photographs of office premises and new industrial buildings are included, including Barclays Bank and the Nairobi Mutual Building. There are also a number of cityscapes, aerial photographs and views of Government Road, Delamere Avenue, Princess Elizabeth Highway, the City Park and Arboretum. There are also several images of the interior and exterior of a modern Nairobi house belonging to ""Russel."" 

There follow a number of images of the East African countryside, including coffee and tea estates, a Kikuyu village, panoramic landscapes and agricultural scenes in areas including Loitokitop and Amboseli as well as sights such as Lake Nakuru (one shot showing tourists), Lake Naivasha ( including the farm of entrepreneur Dorian Rocco), Mt. Longonot, the Ngong Hills and Banda Hotel, Escarpment, Lake Manyara, Murchison Falls and scenes in National Parks including Queen Elizabeth National Park and Tsavo Park. There are also a number of images from the Queen Mother's February 1959 visit to Kenya and Uganda, showing her with Sir Evelyn Baring in the Rift Valley, her lodge at Murchison Falls National Park and the royal train. (There are additional images from the Queen Mother's visit in part 4 below, in 2001/090/1/3/3 and in the album 2001/090/1/4/3.) There are several photographs of the damage caused by the November 1961 floods at Athi, with Trotter's Ford Anglia near the washed away Nairobi-Namanga road bridge. One image of outbuildings with corrugated iron roofs and a safari tent is captioned ""My Shack, Nairobi 1961.""

Parts 4 and 5 contain prints of wild animals which complement the set found at 2001/090/1/3/7. These were originally contained in 3 boxes alongside the one which remains intact, and number nearly 500 images, some of them duplicates. Many of the images are taken at Amboseli National Park, with others at Nairobi National Park, the Ngorongoro crater, Tsavo National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, Lake Nakuru, Rumuruti, Mtito Andei, Rufiji Swamps and around Treetops Hotel in Nyeri. The animals photographed include lions, giraffes, hippos, elephants, rhino, eland, buffalo, foxes, antelopes, reptiles, waterbuck, seabirds, exotic birds, ostrich, bison, baboons, vultures, and okapi. There are several images from Trotter's 1957 safari with Alan Moorehead, other images from which can be found in 2001/090/1/3/9, and also images taken in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, during the Queen Mother's 1959 visit. There are also pictures of elephants looked after by David Sheldrick (Founder Warden of Tsavo National Park), scenes on the Carr-Hartleys' farm still owned by their descendants today and also images of baby animals (lion and cheetah) reared by John Seago, who captured, reared and exported animals to zoos in the USA. 

Part 6, contained in a file, consists of a number of aerial views which have possibly become displaced from the box of aerial views prints at 2001/090/1/3/4, or from another part of the collection. They include images taken from aeroplanes of Mt. Longonot, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Lake Naivasha, a Kikuyu reserve, the Rift Valley, the Kenya Coast and Malindi, the Ngong Hills, a Kenya Regiment camp and photos taken during an air patrol over the visit to Kenya of Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton in 1952, to discuss the Mau Mau crisis.","1951 - 1961","4 boxes","972  b/w photographs, all bearing Trotter's stamp on reverse and many also bearing a negative number and Trotter's manuscript captions.

"2001/090/1/3/2","Trotter","Kenya","African People 1","This box of prints contains images of African people photographed by Trotter. Many are portraits of individuals or small groups pictured outside their homes or  in the course of their daily lives. Tribes which he has photographed in this way include the Masai, Samburu and Turkana and the inhabitants of Kwale, Kilifi and Timboroa. Images of the Turkana tribe at Wamba feature portraits of their chiefs. There are also a number of photographs taken on board a dhow in Mombasa Harbour, and a shot of the Kilifi ferry. Some of these images, including entertainments such as local dancers, were taken on safari trips.  

There are also a large number of images taken at large-scale events, including dancers and drummers at the 1952 and 1956 Royal Shows, the 1955 Concours d' Elegance and the 1955 Kampala Trade Show. Numerous images also date from the visit of Princess Margaret to Kenya in 1956. These include a group of Turkana waving union flags as they wait for her to arrive, and her visits to Machakos where she was entertained by Wakamba dancers and Amboseli where she met members of the Masai tribe.

There are also a small number of images relating to the 1953 Mau Mau uprising. These include shots of a cleansing ceremony, and a man painting the family name on the roof of his house, a common practice.

A number of images included in this section are undated and carry no negative number. At least a proportion of these were taken in the Belgian Congo and feature portraits of local people, described as ""pygmies"" by Trotter, in small groups or engaged in activities such as hunting and various trades. One of these won second prize in a photography competition, according to markings on the reverse.

Another box of images of ""African People"" is at 2001/090/1/3/3, and further related images are in 2001/090/1/3/10.","1951 - 1957","2 files, 1 box","181 b/w photographs, all bearing Trotter's stamp on reverse and many also bearing a negative number and Trotter's manuscript captions.

A small number are portraits from his studio, or close-ups of people he encountered, including a portrait of a dhow captain which markings on reverse suggest was entered for an exhibition or competition, but the majority were taken at events where large groups of people or demonstrations of African culture were featured. 

The most notable of these is the visit of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to Kenya in early 1959: images taken at this time include groups meeting the Queen in Nairobi's Mitchell Park and at Narok, the Royal Agricultural Society of Kenya Show at Eldoret, tribesmen at Kamasia Stadium, Indian dancers at Nairobi City Park, images taken from the Royal train as it passed crowds massed at Sabatia station, Acholi dancers at Murchison Falls Park, a guard of honour at Kampala and a demonstration by Kabaka drummers.

"2001/090/1/4","Trotter","Kenya","Albums","These three albums were all compiled by Charles Trotter, and showcase particular sets of photographs taken in the course of his career. It is possible that there were once more.

The three albums cover the visit of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh to Kenya in February 1952, motor racing at the Langa-Langa circuit in March 1952 and the visit of H.M. the Queen Mother to East Africa in February 1959.","February 1952 - February 1959","1 box","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/1/4/1","Trotter","Kenya","The Royal Visit of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh","This album, compiled by Trotter himself, contains photographs which he took during the visit of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh to Kenya in February 1952. It was during this visit that her father, King George VI died, and she cut short the trip to return home. 

Trotter evidently had permission to attend events during the trip in an official capacity, as the majority of the images are close-ups and taken from vantage points which would have been inaccessible to mere onlookers. The pictures include a small number of images showing preparations for the royal visit around Nairobi, then a number of the Royal party arriving at Eastleigh Airport and greeting the assembled crowds. There follow a number of pictures taken at a garden party in the grounds of Government House, images from a royal tour of the King George VI Hospital and pictures of the Duke of Edinburgh visiting the Kenya Regiment HQ. There are images from a reception at Nairobi's City Hall, the last to feature the Royal couple themselves. The final images in the album are all of Sagana Lodge, gifted to the Princess by the people of Kenya, and where she was due to spend a holiday when she received the news about her father. Instead there is an image of the press conference where the news was broken to journalists, followed by images of the outside of Nairobi Cathedral during a memorial service for the King.

Particularly considering these pictures were taken fairly early in Trotter's photographic career, they include some impressive images of the young Princess in iconic settings such as on the steps of the BOAC aircraft which took her to Kenya, and possibly paved the way for some of Trotter's later commissions.

A small number of the images in this album have duplicates in the sets of prints at 2001/090/1/3, and there are also some enlargements in 2001/090/1/5/5.","February 1952","1 volume","1 hardbacked ""Kalamazet"" binder containing 164 pages, half of which have b/w photographs glued to them.

"2001/090/1/4/2","Trotter","Kenya","Langa-Langa Racing Circuit","The 3 mile Langa-Langa racing circuit at Gilgil in the Rift Valley was inaugurated in 1951 by Eric Cecil using perimeter roads built during WW2. It was only in use for a short time before Mau Mau activities in the mid 1950s rendered the course unsafe. It was also the impetus for the 1953 inauguration of the East African Safari Rally, when Cecil's cousin Neil Vincent declared, with reference to the new circuit, that it was too boring to drive round and round a track!

Trotter's album of 1952 photographs must capture one of relatively few races to be held at Langa-Langa. The images show cars and workers at the service pit, the starting grid for various car and motorbike races and many photographs of individual cars/ bikes and their drivers. There are also several shots of spectators around the perimeter and on the bends. 

Motorsport was one of Trotter's passions, and he photographed many competitions, including the East African Safari Rally over several years. More detail on the cars and their drivers at Langa-Langa can be found in the negative book 2001/090/1/2/1.","March 1952","1 volume","1 hardbacked binder containing 78 pages, half of which have b/w photographs glued to them.

"2001/090/1/4/3","Trotter","Kenya","The Queen Mother's Visit to East Africa","This album, compiled by Trotter, contains 22 pictures of H.M. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's visit to East Africa in February 1959. Trotter took a huge number of photographs during this visit, and this selection represents a very small number of the images available in negative form. As with the photographs of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 2001/090/1/4/1, it is clear that Trotter was allowed considerable access during the visit, and took many photographs at close quarters.

There are a number of pictures taken inside the gardens of Government House, Nairobi, with Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Sir Evelyn and Lady Mary Baring, the Governor of Kenya and his wife. She is also pictured with them at a state reception. There are images of her boarding the Royal train which carried her around Kenya, arriving at Entebbe Airport and in her official car. She is shown making official visits in Nakuru, Aberdare National Park, the Eldoret Show, Baraza and Nakivubu Stadium and inspecting a Police guard of honour at Narok. A number of the images show her being presented with gifts or being cheered by wellwishers.

There are many more photographs from this visit in the sets of prints at 2001/090/1/3, most notably in 2001/090/1/3/ 3 and 2001/090/1/3/10.","February 1959","1 volume","1 hardbacked album containing 24 pages, all but 2 of which have b/w photographs inserted into them.

Many of them have a duplicate elsewhere in the prints collection. They have clearly been enlarged for a variety of reasons including sale, commercial display or entry in competitions. Around half have been annotated on the reverse, with negative numbers, descriptions and/or prices. 

The enlargements have been arranged into boxes along broadly thematic lines including Nairobi and coastal scenes, industry, sporting and wildlife/ scenery. The fifth box is more miscellaneous in nature and includes images from Princess Elizabeth's 1952 visit to Kenya and from various public events.","1951 - 1962","5 boxes","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/1/5/1","Trotter","Kenya","Nairobi & the Coast","The enlarged prints in this box mainly feature scenes of Nairobi and the Kenya Coast, with a small number of miscellaneous images also included. 

The Nairobi pictures include street and aerial views showing 1950s development such as the Princess Elizabeth Highway, the Parliament Building, Law Courts, Church House, Barclays Bank and Kenya Police Headquarters (Kingsway) and commercial buildings including G&R, Bata, Lowiss & Hodgkiss, the interior of several unidentified shops, restaurants and offices, a trade stand at a Kikuyu market and an Esso station.  The pictures taken on the coast include street scenes and seascapes, Fort Jesus and the Likoni and Kilifi ferries at Mombasa and beach scenes on Zanzibar.

"2001/090/1/5/2","Trotter","Kenya","Industrial","The enlarged prints in this box are all on an industrial theme, the majority of them likely to be commissions which Trotter received. Many are unidentified, but they include shots of African, Indian and European workers on factory floors, a laundry, clearing land with heavy machinery, constructing a dam, laying the Mombasa pipeline (Public Works Department), refuelling aircraft and scenes of a slaughterhouse (believed to be owned by the Kenya Meat Commission) and a mine underground. Some of these images, including the airport ones, show participants in the Stanvac Ltd training scheme and there are also scenes in named businesses including Allsops Brewery (interior and exterior shots). There is also a series of images of the processing of sisal, used as a ""picture story"" showing the stages from cultivation and harvesting of the crop through to rope production in a factory.

A large number feature action shots of motorsports events, one of Charles Trotter's great passions. Events featured include motorcycle and rally car events, many of them unidentified but including speedway 1951, Nakuru Park December 1958 and the East African Safari Rally (formerly Coronation safari) 1960 for which Trotter was the official photographer. Various cars and drivers are shown in action and pre/ post race, including Gandhi and Butt with their Simca Aronde, Fritschy and Ellis in their Mercedes 219, and Joghinder and Jaswant Singh in their VW Beetle. There are also several images of the starting grid, cars in action and the stand at Langa-Langa in 1952, companion images to those found in 2001/090/1/4/2. 

There are also several undated action shots of speedboat racing, including women racers, and some action shots of an athletics meet for employees of the East African Post and Telegraph.","1951 - 1960","1 box","27 large b/w photographs all bearing Trotter's stamp on reverse and some also bearing a negative number and/or Trotter's manuscript captions.

"2001/090/1/5/5","Trotter","Kenya","Various","The enlargements in this box cover a variety of occasions photographed by Trotter, and were possibly grouped together on account of their (very large) size. A number of the images are duplicates of the smaller prints of the royal visit of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh to Kenya in February 1952, found in the album 2001/090/1/4/1. These include images of the royal couple arriving in Kenya, the reception at Nairobi City Hall, schoolchildren at a Government House garden party, Sagana Lodge and the exterior of Nairobi Cathedral during the memorial service for King George VI.

There are also a number of images which appear to have been taken at the Nairobi Royal Show in June 1952, including a colour parade in front of the outgoing Governor of Kenya, parades of prizewinning cattle and the Tantoni Hunt, and numerous images of showjumping events. There are also images of Scottish dancing displays during an unidentified agricultural show, and Embu drummers at the Nakuru Show in June 1960.

In addition to this, there is an image of Sir Evelyn Baring, Governor of Kenya, on a dais at an unidentified ceremony, the interior of the home of Roddy Antrobus, a contact of Trotter's in the Royal East African Automobile Association, an unidentified military parade, the interior of the new Stanvac offices and an unidentified factory.","1952 - c. 1962","1 box","37 large b/w photographs all bearing Trotter's stamp on reverse and some also bearing a negative number and/or Trotter's manuscript captions.

Alongside footage of actual events, such as Sir Evelyn Baring's visit to Kikuyu country, are a number of rather amateur reconstructions, including courtroom scenes and Mau Mau ceremonies.

"2001/090/2","Trotter","Cayman Islands","James and Margaret Trotter material","James Maitland Yorke Trotter (generally known as Maitland) took up his first post with the Department of Land and Surveys in Uganda in 1912, after graduating from Cambridge. After a break for war service he returned to the colony, where he later met Margaret Duncan. She was a post office clerk from Scotland, who had travelled to Africa to work in 1918. James and Margaret married in October 1921, and their son Charles was born in 1923. They stayed in Uganda until 1931, when they transferred to Nigeria. There is no evidence of their movements after this, when they possibly returned to the UK.

The material in this section gives a remarkably full insight into the lives of a young couple at this stage in colonial history. Margaret's diary, together with her early photograph albums, reflects the exuberance and adventure which led young people to travel to the colonies, and the comparative freedom which young women could enjoy there. The later albums and loose prints give a similar insight into family life in East Africa, with the frequent social events for the British community and trips home to the UK set alongside the nomadic lifestyle associated with James Trotter's work as a surveyor. Through the diary and photo captions it is mainly Margaret's voice which emerges, in contrast to many of the more official records of colonial life which are primarily concerned with the careers of men.

Also contained with these images are photographs from James Trotter's mother Anna, who was brought up in the Caribbean in the 1870s. Although there are only a small number of these, they allow an insight into three generations of the same family who all lived in the Empire over a period spanning nearly a century.","c. 1870 - 1937","5 boxes","default","default","default","default"

The images include photographs of the memorial tablet and grave of James Bertie Maitland-Makgill-Crichton, Anna's brother, and Edward Everard Rushworth, their stepfather and a Colonial Secretary, who both died in Jamaica in 1877. There are also mounted images of Government House, Carmichael Street and Water Street in Georgetown, Guiana and a photograph taken fromTankerville, St Andrews, Jamaica (May 1870). There are a number of other unidentified photographs, many of them duplicates, including images of Government House in Guiana and Caribbean street scenes, and two pencil sketches of buildings, one dated 1877. There is also a group photograph of the Bishops of Demerara (Guiana), Jamaica, Barbados and Antigua taken at Demerara Government House in 1874. The envelope in which the photographs were contained is marked with the details of James Trotter's father Thomas.","1870s","1 file, 1 envelope","24 sepia photographs and 2 pencil drawings.

"2001/090/2/2","Trotter","Kenya","James and Margaret Trotter Photographs","The photographic material in these boxes documents a large proportion of the life overseas of Margaret Trotter (nee Duncan) and the Trotter family. Beginning with Margaret's voyage out to Africa in 1918 and continuing with pictures of James and Margaret as newlyweds, the albums in 2001/090/2/2/1 then extensively record the early childhood of Charles and the family's life in Uganda before Charles returned to boarding school in the UK and his parents moved to Nigeria. The loose photographs and negatives in 2001/090/2/2/2 cover the same locations and timeframe. The slightly disordered nature of this part of the collection, with duplicate prints in several different albums and jumbled envelopes of negatives, adds a real authenticity to this as the personal archive of a woman who seems to have been passionate about capturing and captioning her memories of an exciting period in her life, and sharing them with others.","1912-1937","3 boxes","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/2/2/1","Trotter","South Africa","Albums","These 12 albums contain images of Charles Trotter's parents and family life during his childhood. They begin with his mother, Margaret Duncan's, photographs from her teenage years and continue with images of her voyage out to East Africa and years working as a Post Office clerk in Kenya and Uganda. Subsequent albums contain photographs of James and Margaret Trotter with Charles as a baby/ child and their life in Uganda as well as visits back to the UK and elsewhere. The final albums in their series show James and Margaret's next posting in Nigeria, after Charles had returned to boarding school in the UK.

The majority of the images are concerned with Margaret, and later the Trotter family's, life overseas, with the main focus on family, friends, ceremonial and social events and comparatively few of local people. A number of the photographs are quite candid, showing Margaret in particular dancing and fooling around with friends. As such they give a real insight into how the family, and other expatriates around them, spent occasions such as Christmases and holidays and celebrated their children's milestones. Margaret's early images taken before her marriage are of particular interest in showing the life of a young woman in Africa in wartime, especially when read in conjunction with her diary of the period, 2001/090/2/3/1.

Most of the albums overlap chronologically, and contain duplicated images. One of the albums appears to have belonged to Charles Trotter at boarding school, and it is possible that others were either compiled for different family members using the same photographs or compiled later in Margaret's life.","1912 - 1937","2 boxes","default","default","default","default"

Most are captioned with the names of those photographed and sometimes locations. Several of the images feature soldiers and nurses in uniform. Two loose photographs are tucked inside the album: a portrait shot of Margaret Duncan and an unlabelled group photograph of WW1 soldiers.","1912 - 1916","1 volume","1 small hardbacked album with 14 pages, all of which have small b/w photographs glued to them, up to 12 per page.

"2001/090/2/2/1/10","Trotter","Uganda","Trotter family Uganda photographs","This album covers much of the Trotter family's period in Uganda in the 1920s. There is a large degree of overlap with photographs in the other albums, especially 2001/090/2/2/1/6-7.

There are a number of images of the family showing Charles as a young boy, and scenes of the forests near their home, as well as their friends and social occasions in Toro and Entebbe. There are pages devoted to the Prince of Wales's visit in October 1928, including a series of large images which are possibly purchases or press photographs. These include sese canoes greeting the Prince's ship, the K.A.R. Band with the Trotter family as bystanders in the foreground, the Trotters about to be presented to HRH and images of a sham fight. There are also photographs of the first aeroplane to land at Entebbe and the family's voyage home on the SS Matiana in 1929 before their European holiday, much of it seemingly spent with friends before visiting family in Scotland. There are also images within the album of an earlier voyage on the SS Mulbera.

The images are not in strictly chronological order, and some from much earlier have been pasted into the middle of the album, including one of James Trotter in Cambridge in 1916, wearing a military uniform and holding a walking stick. Some miscellaneous baby photographs of Charles, his parents and the family home have also been pasted in at intervals, including one of James Trotter posing with a tripod, possibly in the course of his work. The latter pages of the album contain a number of wedding photographs, including James and Margaret on their wedding day in Mombasa on 1 October 1921, and photographs of friends' children which were possibly sent to them. The final images, from 1930, show the family on safari and a view of the Sesebwa Falls, as well as a parade for the opening of the High Court in Kampala. There are 5 photographs tucked into the back of the album, including more of the Trotters on their wedding day and their home in Guernsey.","1916 - 1930","1 volume","1 hardbacked album with 48 pages, all of which have small b/w photographs glued to them.

"2001/090/2/2/1/11","Trotter","Uganda","James Trotter album","This album appears to predominantly contain photographs of James Trotter's career and sporting pursuits, although there are also photographs of the family and young Charles which are in many cases duplicates of those found in other albums. There are several pages of photographs of royal visits, including the Duke and Duchess of York's visit to Uganda in February 1925 and the Prince of Wales's visit in October 1928. Photographs from the 1925 visit include pages devoted to the Omwoleko (ceremonial fight display) at Mengo, a parade at Entebbe Pier and presentation of addresses attended by the Kabaka. There are also several pages devoted to Trotter's rifle shooting pursuits, including pictures of competitions, teams and presentations between 1921 and 1926 and pictures of Trotter and friends at Bisley in 1929. There are also pictures of Sir Alan Cobham making the first flying boat descent on Lake Victoria in February 1928. Family pictures include James, Margaret and Charles in the gardens of their homes and with friends, often at expatriate social events. There are also pictures of the family's trip home on the SS Mulbera in 1926, showing images of Aden and Port Said.  Other photos from Uganda include the Catholic Rubaga Cathedral in Entebbe and several safari pictures of living and hunted animals inclding elephants, lions, rhino, cheetahs and giraffes. Two photographs tucked into the back of the album are of a classroom in Cambridge c. 1907 and a portrait postcard of the Trotter family. Folded inside the front of the album is a news cutting about a parade through London of the returning City Imperial Volunteers around 1900, led by a Major General Trotter.","c. 1921 - 1929","1 volume","1 hardbacked album with 24 pages, all of which have small b/w photographs inserted into mounts in a range of shapes and sizes.

These include pictures of the scenery around Nabagabo, James Trotter's office and Bisley.

The Nigeria images mainly feature James and Margaret Trotter, often with friends, in Lagos and Kaduna, and include the newly opened Nile Bridge in 1931, Lagos Races and street scenes. There are images of their first house in Ikoyi, Lagos and their subsequent house and gardens in Kaduna. Other images from this time include the Kaduna Water Tower, Kaduna River, Government House, the Emir of Zaria, several images of Jos and Zunguru Station. There are also images of local people, including servants, interspersed with many more of the Trotters' social circle.

"2001/090/2/2/1/2","Trotter","Tanzania","Margaret Duncan - Voyage to Africa","This album contains photographs of Margaret Trotter (nee Duncan) on her voyage from the UK to Africa with a group of other Post Office Clerks. The voyage is recounted in some detail in her diary, 2001/090/2/3/1. The photographs show groups of passengers on board the Balmoral Castle (Plymouth-Cape Town) and the Cluny Castle (Cape Town-Mombasa) and passengers and local sights during stops in Durban, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Zanzibar. There is a photograph of the wreck of the SS Konig, sunk by the Germans off Dar-es-Salaam earlier in WW1, as well as street and beach scenes, the Hospital, Post Office and Indian Bazaar. There is also a shot of the Telegraph Bungalow and a group portrait of British military telegraphists visited by Margaret Duncan and her friends, as well as a photograph of a group of Swahili people.

Nearly all of the images are captioned with names of those photographed and their locations. There are images of MD herself, colleagues and other British acquaintances including soldiers at the Post Office Bungalow in Nairobi and at social occasions including tea parties, tennis matches, and plays. There are also photographs of her room inside the Post Office Bungalow, the P.O. Instrument Room on Christmas Day 1918 and the hospital where she was admitted in June 1918. After her convalesence she was posted to Ruiru to undertake slightly easier duties, and this section of the album contains a number of images of the local Kikuyu people and their way of life as well as shots of MD's friends, social life and living quarters similar to those found elsewhere in the album. Of particular note are a photograph of an ""Ngoma"" between Kenyan Askaris and German PoWs from a local camp, an image of the King's African Rifles leaving Nairobi Station for the front and a group of MD's male friends lined up at Ruiru Falls.

In February 1919, MD and her colleague Nell were transferred to Uganda after a farewell picnic at the Post Office Bungalow. There are several images taken on the journey there and a shot of Kampala Cathedral under construction. The Uganda images again show MD's companions, home and numerous social occasions, as well as African Post Office workers and people from the Nubian tribe. There are also several pages of images of peace celebrations in Kampala in August 1919, when the Governor Sir Robert Coryndon presided over several days of parades and sports. Later images show Coryndon on an official visit to Entebbe, meeting local officials and crowds. MD's diary finishes in 1919, but a number of the photographs after this date are taken in Entebbe, including some of the Entebbe Post Office, suggesting that she was possibly working there for a time. These include images of the mail from Britain being unloaded from a mule cart. Other photographs include scenes around Lake Victoria incuding local people and a hippo shoot, the Entebbe football team and a farewell tea party given by the Indian Community for Sir William Morris Carter, Chief Justice.

Photographs in the final third of the album are not captioned, but later images seem to show MD's future husband, James Trotter amongst the scenes of picnics and swimming parties. Some of the final images are taken on a voyage through various European ports of call, presumably on a trip back to the UK. The images are not in strictly chronological order within the album and a small number of images in the middle of the album appear to have been sent to MD from friends or relatives in Mwanza (Tanzania) and South Africa.","May 1918-1921","1 volume","1 hardbacked album with 232 pages, 181 of which have small b/w photographs glued to them.

There are also images taken on board a ship and numerous photographs of places and family members presumed to be in the UK. A number of the duplicate and additional images overlap with those in 2001/090/2/2/1/4 which show Charles Trotter as a newborn baby: in Scotland, on the voyage to Africa and with his father and local people.

There are pictures taken on his 5th birthday and with his pet monkey Marmaduke. One of the pictures shows Charles and several friends next to the first aeroplane to land at Entebbe in November 1928. The Trotters left Uganda in January 1929, and subsequent images show the family with friends in Nairobi and Thika, and on the SS Matiana calling at various ports on the way back to Europe.

The early family pictures are mainly duplicates of those in 2001/090/2/2/1/7, and show Charles with his family, friends, pet monkey, the area around their home in Entebbe and on holiday in France. There are also pictures of James and Margaret Trotter's life in Nigeria, bearing captions such as ""Daddy's new car in front of our house, Lagos."" These images include the Trotters' homes and friends in Lagos and Kaduna and people and places including Jos station, the Emir of Zaria, a local policeman, the River Kaduna from Government Gardens. Many are duplicates of images in 2001/090/2/2/1/12. A series of uncaptioned images show a fire brigade attending a burning building, probably in the UK, and Charles Trotter around the age of 12 in his school uniform.

There is a large degree of overlap between these images and those in the albums 2001/090/2/2/1/1-12.

The majority of the photographs are of the family's life in 1920s Uganda, in particular scenes of ceremonial and social occasions for the expatriate community as well as a large number of family photographs. Later photographs include images of the Trotters' time in Nigeria and the Caribbean, although there are fewer of these. The envelopes of duplicate prints and negatives are extensive, and although in a jumbled state there is probably a negative extant for the majority of the album prints. The instructions for a home-developing tank found within the box of negatives suggests that Margaret possibly developed multiple copies of some prints herself.","c. 1916 - 1935","1 box","default","default","default","default"

Several of the pictures show animal head ""trophies"" and silverware won as prizes in shooting competitions, with Mr de Boltz the team captain, and one picture shows an African hunter carrying several dead animals. There is a group photograph of staff from the Land and Survey Office Commission of Mines which appears to date from the Edwardian period, possibly during James Trotter's early tenure there which began in 1912. There are two cards holding mounted pictures of a safari trip in Uganda, showing overnight camps, porters, Lake Victoria and Margaret being carried, and also additional loose photographs which appear to be from this trip.

"2001/090/2/3/1","Trotter","Kenya","Diary of Margaret Duncan","This diary, written by Margaret Duncan, records her voyage to Africa and first year there, working as a Post Office clerk with a group of other young women. The memoir starts in February 1918 as she boards a ship to Cape Town, where she disembarks before the ship carries on to Australia with a large number of wounded Australian soldiers. After a second voyage up the East Coast of Africa to Nairobi via Durban, Dar-es-Salaam (where her group were ""the first civilian ladies to step ashore following the British occupation"") and Zanzibar she describes her room and housemates in the Post Office Bungalow. Following a period of ill health she is temporarily transferred to Ruiru for quieter duties, where she visits a local POW camp, and finally to Entebbe. 

The writing style is candid and vivacious, and captures the unbridled excitement of a young woman experiencing independence for the first time. She writes in great detail about her acquaintances and social life, all set against the backdrop of the closing months of WW1. Written from a very personal perspective, she records her meetings with soldiers but events such as the actual armistice are glossed over in passing. A rare and fascinating feature of this diary are the descriptions of people and events in the photograph albums 2001/090/2/2/1/2-3, which, taken together, enable a complete picture of Margaret's life to emerge.","1917 - 1919","1 volume","1 hardbacked volume with c. 220 lined pages, around half of them have been written on in ink.","default","default","default"
