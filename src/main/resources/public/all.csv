"2001/090","Trotter","Uganda","Tanzania","Tanganyika","Zanzibar","Nigeria","Jamaica","Cayman Islands","Guyana","South Africa","Kenya","Fonds","Charles Trotter collection","Charles Trotter was born in Scotland in 1923, but at the age of three months he and his mother Margaret returned home to Uganda, where his father James worked in the Land and Surveys Department. With a break for war service, James had been with the same department in Uganda since graduating from Cambridge in 1912. Margaret (nee Duncan) had gone out to Kenya as a Post Office clerk in 1918, and was later transferred to Entebbe, where she met James. They were married in 1921.

For the first 6 years of his life, Charles accompanied his parents on a near-permanent safari owing to the itinerant nature of his father's work. The family mixed almost exclusively within the British colonial community where they enjoyed a busy social life, captured by Margaret who was a keen photographer. In 1929 he returned to the UK to attend boarding school, before becoming a professional photographer. He returned to East Africa on the SS Kenya's maiden voyage in 1951 at the age of 28, capturing life on board ship as the first assignment of this phase of his career. He made Nairobi his home for the following 11 years, during which he established himself as a leading photographer of British-Kenyan high society, royal and ceremonial events, industry, safari, sporting fixtures and landscapes, travelling extensively around East Africa. One of his great passions was motorsport, and he was for some years the official photographer of the East African Safari Rally. He also photographed numerous celebrities, including singers and Hollywood actors, who travelled to Kenya, as well as Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their tour of Kenya in 1952.

Charles Trotter represented Kenya in pistol shooting at the Olympics in both 1956 and 1960. In 1962, a year before independence, he returned to the UK, where he died in 2003. He had recorded an oral history interview with the Museum in 2002 (no. 948).

The material in this collection divides into two main series: work created by Charles Trotter during his photographic career (1948 - 1962) and photographs taken by his parents (predominantly his mother Margaret) prior to 1937 when the family are believed to have returned to the UK. Charles's collection of c. 50,000 negatives are a particularly rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to independence - its landscapes, cities, people, society and industries.  Although currently in a poor state of conservation, many of the images are accessible through the large number of prints which form part of this collection. 

The Trotter family photographs form a fascinating contrast by encapsulating life for a British family in East Africa a generation earlier. They give a particular insight into the opportunities and lifestyle available to Margaret Trotter as a young woman in Africa, and the existence of many of her negatives as well as album prints would enable further study into her recording of this part of her life.

"2001/090/1","Trotter","Congo","Zanzibar","Tanganyika","Tanzania","Kenya","Uganda","default","default","default","default","Series","Charles Trotter - photographic work","After returning to East Africa in his late 20s, Charles Trotter achieved considerable success as a photographer between 1951 and 1962, launching his career with pictures of the voyage out on the maiden voyage of the SS Kenya. Based in Nairobi, his work covered a huge variety of subjects for which he received commissions, such as weddings, family portraits and society occasions (chiefly among the British community), commercial commissions showing industries of the time, and public occasions such as sporting and cultural events and royal visits. There are also a huge number of images which represent his own interests, including African landscapes and wildlife and local people. The majority of the images are taken in Kenya, although other East African countries including Zanzibar, Tanzania and Uganda are also represented. His reputation is demonstrated by his presence behind the scenes at royal visits and on the sets of Hollywood films. The particular research value of the collection lies in the fact that many of the pictures capture the end of Kenya as a colony, and the new roads, civic buildings and factories photographed by Trotter suggest the pride which accompanied independence.

Areas of particular focus and interest include:
 - motorsport, with images from the East African Safari Rally for which Trotter was the official photographer
 - other sporting events, including horse shows, athletics meets and the Kenyan Team at the Melbourne (1956) and Rome (1960) Olympics
- the 1950s expansion of Nairobi, with its large number of new buildings constructed in an attempt to represent a departure from its colonial origins
 - aerial photography of the Kenyan landscape
 - film stills and film stars visiting Kenya on location, including Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable
 - royal visits, including Princess Elizabeth on the visit where she became Queen in 1952 and the Queen Mother in 1959
 - scenes connected to the Mau Mau emergency

The material in this collection includes the complete set of over 50,000 negatives from Trotter's career, together with complete indexes to the images. There are also over 2000 loose prints, 3 albums and c. 150 enlargements taken from the negative collection, as well as c. 330 slides and a film for which Trotter was cameraman.","1948 - 1962","51 boxes, 1 film","default","default","default","default"

Each negative is numbered chronologically and listed, with dates and brief notes, in the accompanying series of negative books (2001/090/1/2), which also contains a subject index. Although Trotter started recording his negatives in 1948, our sequence starts in 1951 around the time he arrived in Kenya and set up his photographic business.","1951-1962","34 boxes","UNFIT FOR PRODUCTION. This series consists of c. 50,000 cellulose acetate Ilford negatives stored in individual numbered sleeves. The majority are 4.75 x 3.75 inch with a sizeable minority being 2.25 x 2.25 inch. Many are in an advanced state of acetate degradation, with the emulsion shrinking away from the acetate base resulting in image loss, and off-gassing occurring. Prior to purchase by BECM, these negatives were analysed by conservation staff at BMAG and at the V&A, and by Ilford Ltd. The state of their deterioration, possibly hastened by their origin in a hot climate, is extreme, and urgent action is required to preserve those images which remain.","default","default","default"

No evidence exists as to why these prints were created or retained, whether they were kept because they reflect some of Trotter's particular interests or whether they are simply all that remain of a larger set.  

The boxes in which the prints were stored cover a defined set of themes, namely the maiden voyage of the SS Kenya, African people, aerial photos, scenery, Mt. Kilimanjaro, wild animals, dhows and views in the East African cities and countryside. There are a small number of more miscellaneous prints including images of motor racing, one of Trotter's passions. Many of the themes and assignments covered by Trotter and represented in his vast negative collection, including images of the White British community in Kenya, do not feature here. They are a particularly rich resource for images of the Kenyan countryside and animals, pre-independence Nairobi and royal visits.","1951 - 1962","8 boxes","default","default","default","default"

An apparently ""missing"" 5 boxes originally contained prints of the SS Kenya, Nairobi and Wild Animals (3 boxes), which overlaps with the subjects of the majority of the photographs here, although other pictures, such as a number of aerial views, have also ended up in this section.

Part 1, contained in a file, consists of a small set of photographs which are mainly believed to have originated in 2001/090/1/3/1-9. These include two images of Jomo Kenyatta on his release from jail in September 1961, two images of dhows which were probably originally part of 2001/090/1/3/8, two images taken during Princess Margaret's visit to Kenya in October 1956, Chuka drummers at the Royal Agricultural Show (these last 3 possibly originally from 2001/090/1/3/2-3), some boy scouts marching and a picture of Maasai tribesmen with Trotter's camera which has a duplicate in part 2 below and a duplicate and companion image at 2001/090/1/5/1/41&42. There are also 2 pictures of motor racing events, taken in 1957 and 1959 respectively, which are larger than the other pictures and appear to have originally been part of a different series again.

Part 2 predominantly contains pictures taken on the S.S. Kenya's maiden voyage in late summer 1951. This is a much more complete set than that found in 2001/090/1/3/1, and contains many additional images as well as a number which are duplicated there. The photographs include views of and from the ship and also document all aspects of onboard life, including entertainments, parties, passengers and crew, and facilities such as the swimming pool. There are also views of destinations passed or called at en route including Gibraltar, Algiers, Port Said, Port Sudan and Mombasa. There are several copies of some of the images. At the beginning of the box are a small number of prints which have possibly been misplaced from elsewhere in the prints collection: these include pictures of wild animals, local people, events during the Queen Mother's 1959 visit to Kenya and an image of Masai tribesmen with Trotter's camera.

Part 3 contains images of East African towns and countryside. Some of the images of landscapes are similar to those contained in 2001/090/1/3/5 and 2001/090/1/3/9, and there may be some duplicates. The series starts with images of Nairobi, but also includes views of Arusha (clock tower), Eldoret, Mombasa (port area with the SS Durban Castle and SS Kenya and Shelly Beach Hotel), Malindi, Gedi, Kampala (Makerere College), Mpanda Airport in Tanzania and Zanzibar. The images of Nairobi are particularly striking in that they mainly depict modern architecture and new buildings constructed in the run up to independence, some of them at varying stages of construction. The buildings featured include the Parliament Building, City Hall, King George VI Hospital, St Andrews Presbyterian Church, New Stanley Hotel, New Technical College, the YWCA swimming pool and Embakazi Airport as well as older buildings such as the National Bank and old New Stanley Hotel building,  A number of photographs of office premises and new industrial buildings are included, including Barclays Bank and the Nairobi Mutual Building. There are also a number of cityscapes, aerial photographs and views of Government Road, Delamere Avenue, Princess Elizabeth Highway, the City Park and Arboretum. There are also several images of the interior and exterior of a modern Nairobi house belonging to ""Russel."" 

There follow a number of images of the East African countryside, including coffee and tea estates, a Kikuyu village, panoramic landscapes and agricultural scenes in areas including Loitokitop and Amboseli as well as sights such as Lake Nakuru (one shot showing tourists), Lake Naivasha ( including the farm of entrepreneur Dorian Rocco), Mt. Longonot, the Ngong Hills and Banda Hotel, Escarpment, Lake Manyara, Murchison Falls and scenes in National Parks including Queen Elizabeth National Park and Tsavo Park. There are also a number of images from the Queen Mother's February 1959 visit to Kenya and Uganda, showing her with Sir Evelyn Baring in the Rift Valley, her lodge at Murchison Falls National Park and the royal train. (There are additional images from the Queen Mother's visit in part 4 below, in 2001/090/1/3/3 and in the album 2001/090/1/4/3.) There are several photographs of the damage caused by the November 1961 floods at Athi, with Trotter's Ford Anglia near the washed away Nairobi-Namanga road bridge. One image of outbuildings with corrugated iron roofs and a safari tent is captioned ""My Shack, Nairobi 1961.""

Parts 4 and 5 contain prints of wild animals which complement the set found at 2001/090/1/3/7. These were originally contained in 3 boxes alongside the one which remains intact, and number nearly 500 images, some of them duplicates. Many of the images are taken at Amboseli National Park, with others at Nairobi National Park, the Ngorongoro crater, Tsavo National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, Lake Nakuru, Rumuruti, Mtito Andei, Rufiji Swamps and around Treetops Hotel in Nyeri. The animals photographed include lions, giraffes, hippos, elephants, rhino, eland, buffalo, foxes, antelopes, reptiles, waterbuck, seabirds, exotic birds, ostrich, bison, baboons, vultures, and okapi. There are several images from Trotter's 1957 safari with Alan Moorehead, other images from which can be found in 2001/090/1/3/9, and also images taken in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, during the Queen Mother's 1959 visit. There are also pictures of elephants looked after by David Sheldrick (Founder Warden of Tsavo National Park), scenes on the Carr-Hartleys' farm still owned by their descendants today and also images of baby animals (lion and cheetah) reared by John Seago, who captured, reared and exported animals to zoos in the USA. 

Part 6, contained in a file, consists of a number of aerial views which have possibly become displaced from the box of aerial views prints at 2001/090/1/3/4, or from another part of the collection. They include images taken from aeroplanes of Mt. Longonot, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Lake Naivasha, a Kikuyu reserve, the Rift Valley, the Kenya Coast and Malindi, the Ngong Hills, a Kenya Regiment camp and photos taken during an air patrol over the visit to Kenya of Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton in 1952, to discuss the Mau Mau crisis.","1951 - 1961","4 boxes","972  b/w photographs, all bearing Trotter's stamp on reverse and many also bearing a negative number and Trotter's manuscript captions.

Many are portraits of individuals or small groups pictured outside their homes or  in the course of their daily lives. Tribes which he has photographed in this way include the Masai, Samburu and Turkana and the inhabitants of Kwale, Kilifi and Timboroa. Images of the Turkana tribe at Wamba feature portraits of their chiefs. There are also a number of photographs taken on board a dhow in Mombasa Harbour, and a shot of the Kilifi ferry. Some of these images, including entertainments such as local dancers, were taken on safari trips.  

There are also a large number of images taken at large-scale events, including dancers and drummers at the 1952 and 1956 Royal Shows, the 1955 Concours d' Elegance and the 1955 Kampala Trade Show. Numerous images also date from the visit of Princess Margaret to Kenya in 1956. These include a group of Turkana waving union flags as they wait for her to arrive, and her visits to Machakos where she was entertained by Wakamba dancers and Amboseli where she met members of the Masai tribe.

There are also a small number of images relating to the 1953 Mau Mau uprising. These include shots of a cleansing ceremony, and a man painting the family name on the roof of his house, a common practice.

A number of images included in this section are undated and carry no negative number. At least a proportion of these were taken in the Belgian Congo and feature portraits of local people, described as ""pygmies"" by Trotter, in small groups or engaged in activities such as hunting and various trades. One of these won second prize in a photography competition, according to markings on the reverse.

Other images include the Treetops hotel in Nyeri, Kilimanjaro, the Ngorongoro Crater and villages in the vicinity, the sunset over Amboseli, Thomson's Falls and the Fourteen Falls. One shot at the Fourteen Falls shows the set up of Trotter's photographic equipment.

Trotter is known for the commissions he took for photographs of well-known figures; included here are images of the writer and hunter Alastair Scobie driving and exploring around native villages and photos from a safari trip with the writer Alan Moorehead (other images from this trip can be found in 2001/090/1/3/10).

It was during this visit that her father, King George VI died, and she cut short the trip to return home. 

Trotter evidently had permission to attend events during the trip in an official capacity, as the majority of the images are close-ups and taken from vantage points which would have been inaccessible to mere onlookers. The pictures include a small number of images showing preparations for the royal visit around Nairobi, then a number of the Royal party arriving at Eastleigh Airport and greeting the assembled crowds. There follow a number of pictures taken at a garden party in the grounds of Government House, images from a royal tour of the King George VI Hospital and pictures of the Duke of Edinburgh visiting the Kenya Regiment HQ. There are images from a reception at Nairobi's City Hall, the last to feature the Royal couple themselves. The final images in the album are all of Sagana Lodge, gifted to the Princess by the people of Kenya, and where she was due to spend a holiday when she received the news about her father. Instead there is an image of the press conference where the news was broken to journalists, followed by images of the outside of Nairobi Cathedral during a memorial service for the King.

Particularly considering these pictures were taken fairly early in Trotter's photographic career, they include some impressive images of the young Princess in iconic settings such as on the steps of the BOAC aircraft which took her to Kenya, and possibly paved the way for some of Trotter's later commissions.

A small number of the images in this album have duplicates in the sets of prints at 2001/090/1/3, and there are also some enlargements in 2001/090/1/5/5.","February 1952","1 volume","1 hardbacked ""Kalamazet"" binder containing 164 pages, half of which have b/w photographs glued to them.

It was only in use for a short time before Mau Mau activities in the mid 1950s rendered the course unsafe. It was also the impetus for the 1953 inauguration of the East African Safari Rally, when Cecil's cousin Neil Vincent declared, with reference to the new circuit, that it was too boring to drive round and round a track!

Trotter's album of 1952 photographs must capture one of relatively few races to be held at Langa-Langa. The images show cars and workers at the service pit, the starting grid for various car and motorbike races and many photographs of individual cars/ bikes and their drivers. There are also several shots of spectators around the perimeter and on the bends. 

Motorsport was one of Trotter's passions, and he photographed many competitions, including the East African Safari Rally over several years. More detail on the cars and their drivers at Langa-Langa can be found in the negative book 2001/090/1/2/1.","March 1952","1 volume","1 hardbacked binder containing 78 pages, half of which have b/w photographs glued to them.

Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's visit to East Africa in February 1959. Trotter took a huge number of photographs during this visit, and this selection represents a very small number of the images available in negative form. As with the photographs of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 2001/090/1/4/1, it is clear that Trotter was allowed considerable access during the visit, and took many photographs at close quarters.

There are a number of pictures taken inside the gardens of Government House, Nairobi, with Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Sir Evelyn and Lady Mary Baring, the Governor of Kenya and his wife. She is also pictured with them at a state reception. There are images of her boarding the Royal train which carried her around Kenya, arriving at Entebbe Airport and in her official car. She is shown making official visits in Nakuru, Aberdare National Park, the Eldoret Show, Baraza and Nakivubu Stadium and inspecting a Police guard of honour at Narok. A number of the images show her being presented with gifts or being cheered by wellwishers.

There are many more photographs from this visit in the sets of prints at 2001/090/1/3, most notably in 2001/090/1/3/ 3 and 2001/090/1/3/10.","February 1959","1 volume","1 hardbacked album containing 24 pages, all but 2 of which have b/w photographs inserted into them.

After a break for war service he returned to the colony, where he later met Margaret Duncan. She was a post office clerk from Scotland, who had travelled to Africa to work in 1918. James and Margaret married in October 1921, and their son Charles was born in 1923. They stayed in Uganda until 1931, when they transferred to Nigeria. There is no evidence of their movements after this, when they possibly returned to the UK.

The material in this section gives a remarkably full insight into the lives of a young couple at this stage in colonial history. Margaret's diary, together with her early photograph albums, reflects the exuberance and adventure which led young people to travel to the colonies, and the comparative freedom which young women could enjoy there. The later albums and loose prints give a similar insight into family life in East Africa, with the frequent social events for the British community and trips home to the UK set alongside the nomadic lifestyle associated with James Trotter's work as a surveyor. Through the diary and photo captions it is mainly Margaret's voice which emerges, in contrast to many of the more official records of colonial life which are primarily concerned with the careers of men.

Also contained with these images are photographs from James Trotter's mother Anna, who was brought up in the Caribbean in the 1870s. Although there are only a small number of these, they allow an insight into three generations of the same family who all lived in the Empire over a period spanning nearly a century.","c. 1870 - 1937","5 boxes","default","default","default","default"

There are also mounted images of Government House, Carmichael Street and Water Street in Georgetown, Guiana and a photograph taken fromTankerville, St Andrews, Jamaica (May 1870). There are a number of other unidentified photographs, many of them duplicates, including images of Government House in Guiana and Caribbean street scenes, and two pencil sketches of buildings, one dated 1877.

The loose photographs and negatives in 2001/090/2/2/2 cover the same locations and timeframe. The slightly disordered nature of this part of the collection, with duplicate prints in several different albums and jumbled envelopes of negatives, adds a real authenticity to this as the personal archive of a woman who seems to have been passionate about capturing and captioning her memories of an exciting period in her life, and sharing them with others.","1912-1937","3 boxes","default","default","default","default"
"2001/090/2/2/1","Trotter","South Africa","Cayman Islands","Guyana","Tanzania","Nigeria","Kenya","Uganda","UK","Barbados","Zanzibar","Series","Albums","These 12 albums contain images of Charles Trotter's parents and family life during his childhood. They begin with his mother, Margaret Duncan's, photographs from her teenage years and continue with images of her voyage out to East Africa and years working as a Post Office clerk in Kenya and Uganda. Subsequent albums contain photographs of James and Margaret Trotter with Charles as a baby/ child and their life in Uganda as well as visits back to the UK and elsewhere. The final albums in their series show James and Margaret's next posting in Nigeria, after Charles had returned to boarding school in the UK.

The majority of the images are concerned with Margaret, and later the Trotter family's, life overseas, with the main focus on family, friends, ceremonial and social events and comparatively few of local people. A number of the photographs are quite candid, showing Margaret in particular dancing and fooling around with friends. As such they give a real insight into how the family, and other expatriates around them, spent occasions such as Christmases and holidays and celebrated their children's milestones. Margaret's early images taken before her marriage are of particular interest in showing the life of a young woman in Africa in wartime, especially when read in conjunction with her diary of the period, 2001/090/2/3/1.

Most of the albums overlap chronologically, and contain duplicated images. One of the albums appears to have belonged to Charles Trotter at boarding school, and it is possible that others were either compiled for different family members using the same photographs or compiled later in Margaret's life.","1912 - 1937","2 boxes","default","default","default","default"

There is a large degree of overlap with photographs in the other albums, especially 2001/090/2/2/1/6-7.

There are a number of images of the family showing Charles as a young boy, and scenes of the forests near their home, as well as their friends and social occasions in Toro and Entebbe. There are pages devoted to the Prince of Wales's visit in October 1928, including a series of large images which are possibly purchases or press photographs. These include sese canoes greeting the Prince's ship, the K.A.R. Band with the Trotter family as bystanders in the foreground, the Trotters about to be presented to HRH and images of a sham fight. There are also photographs of the first aeroplane to land at Entebbe and the family's voyage home on the SS Matiana in 1929 before their European holiday, much of it seemingly spent with friends before visiting family in Scotland. There are also images within the album of an earlier voyage on the SS Mulbera.

The images are not in strictly chronological order, and some from much earlier have been pasted into the middle of the album, including one of James Trotter in Cambridge in 1916, wearing a military uniform and holding a walking stick. Some miscellaneous baby photographs of Charles, his parents and the family home have also been pasted in at intervals, including one of James Trotter posing with a tripod, possibly in the course of his work. The latter pages of the album contain a number of wedding photographs, including James and Margaret on their wedding day in Mombasa on 1 October 1921, and photographs of friends' children which were possibly sent to them. The final images, from 1930, show the family on safari and a view of the Sesebwa Falls, as well as a parade for the opening of the High Court in Kampala. There are 5 photographs tucked into the back of the album, including more of the Trotters on their wedding day and their home in Guernsey.","1916 - 1930","1 volume","1 hardbacked album with 48 pages, all of which have small b/w photographs glued to them.

Photographs from the 1925 visit include pages devoted to the Omwoleko (ceremonial fight display) at Mengo, a parade at Entebbe Pier and presentation of addresses attended by the Kabaka. There are also several pages devoted to Trotter's rifle shooting pursuits, including pictures of competitions, teams and presentations between 1921 and 1926 and pictures of Trotter and friends at Bisley in 1929. There are also pictures of Sir Alan Cobham making the first flying boat descent on Lake Victoria in February 1928. Family pictures include James, Margaret and Charles in the gardens of their homes and with friends, often at expatriate social events. There are also pictures of the family's trip home on the SS Mulbera in 1926, showing images of Aden and Port Said.  Other photos from Uganda include the Catholic Rubaga Cathedral in Entebbe and several safari pictures of living and hunted animals inclding elephants, lions, rhino, cheetahs and giraffes. Two photographs tucked into the back of the album are of a classroom in Cambridge c. 1907 and a portrait postcard of the Trotter family.

The Nigeria images mainly feature James and Margaret Trotter, often with friends, in Lagos and Kaduna, and include the newly opened Nile Bridge in 1931, Lagos Races and street scenes.

Nearly all of the images are captioned with names of those photographed and their locations. There are images of MD herself, colleagues and other British acquaintances including soldiers at the Post Office Bungalow in Nairobi and at social occasions including tea parties, tennis matches, and plays. There are also photographs of her room inside the Post Office Bungalow, the P.O. Instrument Room on Christmas Day 1918 and the hospital where she was admitted in June 1918. After her convalesence she was posted to Ruiru to undertake slightly easier duties, and this section of the album contains a number of images of the local Kikuyu people and their way of life as well as shots of MD's friends, social life and living quarters similar to those found elsewhere in the album. Of particular note are a photograph of an ""Ngoma"" between Kenyan Askaris and German PoWs from a local camp, an image of the King's African Rifles leaving Nairobi Station for the front and a group of MD's male friends lined up at Ruiru Falls.

In February 1919, MD and her colleague Nell were transferred to Uganda after a farewell picnic at the Post Office Bungalow. There are several images taken on the journey there and a shot of Kampala Cathedral under construction. The Uganda images again show MD's companions, home and numerous social occasions, as well as African Post Office workers and people from the Nubian tribe. There are also several pages of images of peace celebrations in Kampala in August 1919, when the Governor Sir Robert Coryndon presided over several days of parades and sports. Later images show Coryndon on an official visit to Entebbe, meeting local officials and crowds. MD's diary finishes in 1919, but a number of the photographs after this date are taken in Entebbe, including some of the Entebbe Post Office, suggesting that she was possibly working there for a time. These include images of the mail from Britain being unloaded from a mule cart. Other photographs include scenes around Lake Victoria incuding local people and a hippo shoot, the Entebbe football team and a farewell tea party given by the Indian Community for Sir William Morris Carter, Chief Justice.

Photographs in the final third of the album are not captioned, but later images seem to show MD's future husband, James Trotter amongst the scenes of picnics and swimming parties. Some of the final images are taken on a voyage through various European ports of call, presumably on a trip back to the UK. The images are not in strictly chronological order within the album and a small number of images in the middle of the album appear to have been sent to MD from friends or relatives in Mwanza (Tanzania) and South Africa.","May 1918-1921","1 volume","1 hardbacked album with 232 pages, 181 of which have small b/w photographs glued to them.

The memoir starts in February 1918 as she boards a ship to Cape Town, where she disembarks before the ship carries on to Australia with a large number of wounded Australian soldiers. After a second voyage up the East Coast of Africa to Nairobi via Durban, Dar-es-Salaam (where her group were ""the first civilian ladies to step ashore following the British occupation"") and Zanzibar she describes her room and housemates in the Post Office Bungalow. Following a period of ill health she is temporarily transferred to Ruiru for quieter duties, where she visits a local POW camp, and finally to Entebbe. 

The writing style is candid and vivacious, and captures the unbridled excitement of a young woman experiencing independence for the first time. She writes in great detail about her acquaintances and social life, all set against the backdrop of the closing months of WW1. Written from a very personal perspective, she records her meetings with soldiers but events such as the actual armistice are glossed over in passing. A rare and fascinating feature of this diary are the descriptions of people and events in the photograph albums 2001/090/2/2/1/2-3, which, taken together, enable a complete picture of Margaret's life to emerge.","1917 - 1919","1 volume","1 hardbacked volume with c. 220 lined pages, around half of them have been written on in ink.","default","default","default"

"2009/008","Haslam","Persian Gulf","Uganda","Bahrain","India","Kenya","Rwanda","Zambia","Canada","Zimbabwe","Tanzania","Fonds","Haslam collection","Ivan Haslam grew up in Jabalpur in India. After he finished university in 1943, he joined the Persian Gulf Service and served in Muscat for two years. He worked for the Political Resident whose responsibilities included the oversight of foreign relations of the Sheikdoms of the Gulf and jurisdiction over foreigners in the Arab State. Part of Haslam's role was as Censor officer for all outgoing mail.
In his biographical notes he says that Muscat was isolated during the war, receiving ships only if a convoy could be found. 'We were also visited by the occasional tramp ship. The SS Daphu was one such and escaped from the war in the Far East. It was torpedoed whilst in Muscat Harbour and was not cleared until well after the war ended.' He refers to the fact that during the war he handled 'confidential matters including the movement of ships, and telegram correspondence relating to the oil negotiations with the Gulf Sheikhs.'
In 1948 Haslam was transferred to Bahrain when responsibility was moved from the India Office on its closure to the Colonial Office. The Gulf States objected that non-UK nationals (Haslam is Indian) were handling confidential matters. Haslam and five other Indians were later transferred to the Foreign Service of the newly independent Government of India in New Delhi.
Haslam was posted to the office of the Indian Commissioner in East Africa in the early 1950s, based in Nairobi. This role meant extensive travel to many countries south of the Sahara, and during this time he visited several game reserves and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He was in Nairobi when Princess Elizabeth made the State Visit during which her father died and she became Queen. 
In 1956 Haslam was posted to the Indian High Commission in London where he met his future wife Mary Russell. He later worked for the London County Council and its successor bodies, retiring in 1989. Ivan Haslam died in April 2016.

This collection consists of two series - (1) a set of 3 photograph albums and (2) 12 films. The albums cover Haslam's time in the Gulf, India and East Africa. The films mainly show his time in East Africa, but there are also films taken during his travels eg in Canada, India and the UK.","1940s-1960","2 boxes","default","2009-008-001.avi","[Copyright] Bristol Record Office","243813"

This film shows scenes taken during a safari and includes many shots of wildlife. It is interesting in the context of westernised Indians on safari, including women. Haslam's notes refer to an outing on the Serengeti Plains and being forced to spend the night in the car which might refer to this trip, though there are several films showing footage taken on safaris in the collection. 

Detailed description
Large group of Indians (including one man with Sikh turban, several women and children) gathering at fixed camp in the bush. Sightings of game including zebra, extended shot of herd of elephants, lionesses, and giraffe. Africans walking past - perhaps local villagers, one with a child. Herd of antelope and a sighting of a rhino. Two tall Africans, wearing large earrings and carrying a staff flank Indian with camera.  
Further shots of lioness and elephants, a herd of antelope and large crane or stork startled from the undergrowth. Slow progress of elephants interspersed with view of lioness, a sense of being closer to the game.
05:37 The group is seated at a long table before a tent, eating. Back to view of game - two ostrich, and four or five galloping giraffe. This continues towards the treeline, glimpse of monkeys and several rhino. Herd of zebra. 
07:39 It appears to be night beside a river, but very brief shot, followed by long sequence of elephants and a running antelope. 
08.18 Back to the river, and the film shows half submerged hippos, two of which begin to emerge [taken at Mzima Springs?]. Film returns to distant shots of horned rhino and calf, antelope. Two rhino confront each other, dust rises, antelope wait placidly. 
10.37 A figure (Indian) strolls across the long grass. In the distance the herd of elephant move across the camera, the size of the herd now clearer, maybe 12 in this shot. View of monkeys, and of two giraffe. A lioness pauses and looks back at the camera. Views of ostrich, zebra, antelope (okapi?), close up of emu and ostrich, herd of gnu.   
13.20 Sky is darker, cloudy. Gnu jostle and tussle, and a two jackal appear, ahead of a larger group.  
13.50 It is dark, and shadowy image in the distance is a spotted cat [cheetah?] In background, shape of cars at the night safari. 
14.24 Another shape comes out of the darkness - a lion is filmed close-up.","[c.1951-1953]","1 film 16mm digitised","1 film in metal can. Major vinegar syndrome.

The theme of this film is London sightseeing, but has been taken over several months, from springtime blossom to late summer flowers. There are iconic images of trooping the colour together with Piccadilly Circus by day and night when neon advertising was seen as a spectacle.

Detailed description
Scenes in London - Trooping the Colour, Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column. Footage of spring blossom and daffodils, presumably a city park with ornamental lake. 
04:45 Summer rose gardens.
05:55 Close-up of woman and pale green car with AA badge on car. Boats in a salt marsh creek.
06:33 Tower Bridge, including double decker crossing the bridge. Tower of London with red telephone kiosks and Union Jack flying. St Paul’s Cathedral.

R. Elliott, former headmaster of Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Gainsborough where Elliott was a pupil. He fought in the Boer War as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment. In 1907 he joined the East Africa Police and in 1908 was made District Superintendent of Police for Jubaland, British East Africa (now Somalia). In 1913 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society for his research on Jubaland. On the outbreak of WW1, Elliott rejoined the Lincolnshire Regiment, attached to the King's African Rifles. He worked as an intelligence officer against the Marehan Somalis, and was mentioned in despatches. In 1915 Elliott saw action on the border with German East Africa as a temporary Captain in the K.A.R. and on his return was made District Commissioner of Jubaland. Owing to K.A.R. regular troops being deployed elsewhere in East Africa as the war waged on, the defence of Jubaland was left to African police troops working under Elliott. He was killed alongside a number of his men at Serenli on the Juba River on 2nd February 1916, aged 35, during an attack on his station by hostile Somalis, and was buried at Bardera.

This collection contains Elliott's photograph album detailing his life in Kenya and Somalia before WW1, a folder of his letters home, his book ""Jubaland and its Inhabitants"", a pamphlet describing his war grave and a 1908 map of Jubaland used during the course of his Police work.
