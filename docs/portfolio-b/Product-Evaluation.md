# Evaluation

To evaluate our product we decided an interview type meeting with our client, A Bristol culture employee for the council, would be best in assessing whether we had developed a product that met the clients requirements, asking them questions while they tested our product, navigating our web application, using the different features that do not require much explanation on how to use. These features included the simple search and advanced search, as these are features that we knew the client would be familiar with as they have seen these features be developed over the course of time we have worked with them. We were also familiar with these interview type meetings as we had structured our interactions with our client this way throughout the year, providing us with detailed information enabling us to further develop the product effectively, therefore as we deemed this method successful we chose to evaluate our product this way.

While they used the simple search and advanced search features we asked them questions such as: "Does it feel responsive, do you feel that it is faster to search the database?" to which they responded "Yes, a lot faster, compared to our other system, you've seen how slow it is, taking 10-15 minutes to return a result so your product taking a few seconds is great." We noted these responses down to ensure we knew what we had done correctly and what needed slight adjusting. After 15 minutes of questioning the user while they used these features, we took back control of the product as we wanted to show the client the upload csv functionality that they would not understand without an explanation, something we will provide a manual for, ensuring that it is used correctly. The client further confirmed how necessary a user manual was as they directly asked for one after the demonstration, to which we replied that we already had this in mind. 

After positive feedback about what we had produced we asked the client if they felt anything was missing or possibly could be added, to improve the product. Though they did not think anything was missing, they did ask for potential additional features that could be added to the product. Though we believed most of the suggestions would be good additions, there was not enough time to fully implement these features. For example one suggestion was to have a different method of browsing, a method that allows you to browse through all the images, something what would require quite a lot of attention to implement. We explained to the client that features like this were not going to be in the final version of the project due to the close deadline, they understood this and expressed that they were pleased with the current state of our product.

Despite most of their additional feedback being to complicated to implement in the short amount of time there were suggestions that we could implement. For example, they asked for a bit of information about how to successfully upload csv files without a problem. This would be alongside the user guide on how to use our product, and would be displayed on the webpage where you upload the files. We already knew that we needed to make minor UI tweaks before the final release so this was something we could quite easily, and it would help to ensure that user upload csv files correctly so that errors and problems are not caused.
