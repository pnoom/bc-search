With a break for war service, James had been with the same department in Uganda since graduating from Cambridge in 1912. Margaret (nee Duncan) had gone out to Kenya as a Post Office clerk in 1918, and was later transferred to Entebbe, where she met James. They were married in 1921.

For the first 6 years of his life, Charles accompanied his parents on a near-permanent safari owing to the itinerant nature of his father\'s work. The family mixed almost exclusively within the British colonial community where they enjoyed a busy social life, captured by Margaret who was a keen photographer. In 1929 he returned to the UK to attend boarding school, before becoming a professional photographer. He returned to East Africa on the SS Kenya\'s maiden voyage in 1951 at the age of 28, capturing life on board ship as the first assignment of this phase of his career. He made Nairobi his home for the following 11 years, during which he established himself as a leading photographer of British-Kenyan high society, royal and ceremonial events, industry, safari, sporting fixtures and landscapes, travelling extensively around East Africa. One of his great passions was motorsport, and he was for some years the official photographer of the East African Safari Rally. He also photographed numerous celebrities, including singers and Hollywood actors, who travelled to Kenya, as well as Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their tour of Kenya in 1952.

Charles Trotter represented Kenya in pistol shooting at the Olympics in both 1956 and 1960. In 1962, a year before independence, he returned to the UK, where he died in 2003. He had recorded an oral history interview with the Museum in 2002 (no. 948).

The material in this collection divides into two main series: work created by Charles Trotter during his photographic career (1948 - 1962) and photographs taken by his parents (predominantly his mother Margaret) prior to 1937 when the family are believed to have returned to the UK. Charles\'s collection of c. 50,000 negatives are a particularly rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to independence - its landscapes, cities, people, society and industries.  Although currently in a poor state of conservation, many of the images are accessible through the large number of prints which form part of this collection. 

The Trotter family photographs form a fascinating contrast by encapsulating life for a British family in East Africa a generation earlier. They give a particular insight into the opportunities and lifestyle available to Margaret Trotter as a young woman in Africa, and the existence of many of her negatives as well as album prints would enable further study into her recording of this part of her life.

Based in Nairobi, his work covered a huge variety of subjects for which he received commissions, such as weddings, family portraits and society occasions (chiefly among the British community), commercial commissions showing industries of the time, and public occasions such as sporting and cultural events and royal visits. There are also a huge number of images which represent his own interests, including African landscapes and wildlife and local people. The majority of the images are taken in Kenya, although other East African countries including Zanzibar, Tanzania and Uganda are also represented. His reputation is demonstrated by his presence behind the scenes at royal visits and on the sets of Hollywood films. The particular research value of the collection lies in the fact that many of the pictures capture the end of Kenya as a colony, and the new roads, civic buildings and factories photographed by Trotter suggest the pride which accompanied independence.

Areas of particular focus and interest include:
 - motorsport, with images from the East African Safari Rally for which Trotter was the official photographer
 - other sporting events, including horse shows, athletics meets and the Kenyan Team at the Melbourne (1956) and Rome (1960) Olympics
- the 1950s expansion of Nairobi, with its large number of new buildings constructed in an attempt to represent a departure from its colonial origins
 - aerial photography of the Kenyan landscape
 - film stills and film stars visiting Kenya on location, including Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable
 - royal visits, including Princess Elizabeth on the visit where she became Queen in 1952 and the Queen Mother in 1959
 - scenes connected to the Mau Mau emergency

The material in this collection includes the complete set of over 50,000 negatives from Trotter\'s career, together with complete indexes to the images. There are also over 2000 loose prints, 3 albums and c. 150 enlargements taken from the negative collection, as well as c. 330 slides and a film for which Trotter was cameraman.', '1948 - 1962', 'default', '51 boxes, 1 film', 'default', 6);

The boxes in which the prints were stored cover a defined set of themes, namely the maiden voyage of the SS Kenya, African people, aerial photos, scenery, Mt. Kilimanjaro, wild animals, dhows and views in the East African cities and countryside. There are a small number of more miscellaneous prints including images of motor racing, one of Trotter\'s passions.

An apparently "missing" 5 boxes originally contained prints of the SS Kenya, Nairobi and Wild Animals (3 boxes), which overlaps with the subjects of the majority of the photographs here, although other pictures, such as a number of aerial views, have also ended up in this section.

Part 1, contained in a file, consists of a small set of photographs which are mainly believed to have originated in 2001/090/1/3/1-9. These include two images of Jomo Kenyatta on his release from jail in September 1961, two images of dhows which were probably originally part of 2001/090/1/3/8, two images taken during Princess Margaret\'s visit to Kenya in October 1956, Chuka drummers at the Royal Agricultural Show (these last 3 possibly originally from 2001/090/1/3/2-3), some boy scouts marching and a picture of Maasai tribesmen with Trotter\'s camera which has a duplicate in part 2 below and a duplicate and companion image at 2001/090/1/5/1/41&42. There are also 2 pictures of motor racing events, taken in 1957 and 1959 respectively, which are larger than the other pictures and appear to have originally been part of a different series again.

Part 2 predominantly contains pictures taken on the S.S. Kenya\'s maiden voyage in late summer 1951. This is a much more complete set than that found in 2001/090/1/3/1, and contains many additional images as well as a number which are duplicated there. The photographs include views of and from the ship and also document all aspects of onboard life, including entertainments, parties, passengers and crew, and facilities such as the swimming pool. There are also views of destinations passed or called at en route including Gibraltar, Algiers, Port Said, Port Sudan and Mombasa. There are several copies of some of the images. At the beginning of the box are a small number of prints which have possibly been misplaced from elsewhere in the prints collection: these include pictures of wild animals, local people, events during the Queen Mother\'s 1959 visit to Kenya and an image of Masai tribesmen with Trotter\'s camera.

Part 3 contains images of East African towns and countryside. Some of the images of landscapes are similar to those contained in 2001/090/1/3/5 and 2001/090/1/3/9, and there may be some duplicates. The series starts with images of Nairobi, but also includes views of Arusha (clock tower), Eldoret, Mombasa (port area with the SS Durban Castle and SS Kenya and Shelly Beach Hotel), Malindi, Gedi, Kampala (Makerere College), Mpanda Airport in Tanzania and Zanzibar. The images of Nairobi are particularly striking in that they mainly depict modern architecture and new buildings constructed in the run up to independence, some of them at varying stages of construction. The buildings featured include the Parliament Building, City Hall, King George VI Hospital, St Andrews Presbyterian Church, New Stanley Hotel, New Technical College, the YWCA swimming pool and Embakazi Airport as well as older buildings such as the National Bank and old New Stanley Hotel building,  A number of photographs of office premises and new industrial buildings are included, including Barclays Bank and the Nairobi Mutual Building. There are also a number of cityscapes, aerial photographs and views of Government Road, Delamere Avenue, Princess Elizabeth Highway, the City Park and Arboretum. There are also several images of the interior and exterior of a modern Nairobi house belonging to "Russel." 

There follow a number of images of the East African countryside, including coffee and tea estates, a Kikuyu village, panoramic landscapes and agricultural scenes in areas including Loitokitop and Amboseli as well as sights such as Lake Nakuru (one shot showing tourists), Lake Naivasha ( including the farm of entrepreneur Dorian Rocco), Mt. Longonot, the Ngong Hills and Banda Hotel, Escarpment, Lake Manyara, Murchison Falls and scenes in National Parks including Queen Elizabeth National Park and Tsavo Park. There are also a number of images from the Queen Mother\'s February 1959 visit to Kenya and Uganda, showing her with Sir Evelyn Baring in the Rift Valley, her lodge at Murchison Falls National Park and the royal train. (There are additional images from the Queen Mother\'s visit in part 4 below, in 2001/090/1/3/3 and in the album 2001/090/1/4/3.) There are several photographs of the damage caused by the November 1961 floods at Athi, with Trotter\'s Ford Anglia near the washed away Nairobi-Namanga road bridge. One image of outbuildings with corrugated iron roofs and a safari tent is captioned "My Shack, Nairobi 1961."

Parts 4 and 5 contain prints of wild animals which complement the set found at 2001/090/1/3/7. These were originally contained in 3 boxes alongside the one which remains intact, and number nearly 500 images, some of them duplicates. Many of the images are taken at Amboseli National Park, with others at Nairobi National Park, the Ngorongoro crater, Tsavo National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, Lake Nakuru, Rumuruti, Mtito Andei, Rufiji Swamps and around Treetops Hotel in Nyeri. The animals photographed include lions, giraffes, hippos, elephants, rhino, eland, buffalo, foxes, antelopes, reptiles, waterbuck, seabirds, exotic birds, ostrich, bison, baboons, vultures, and okapi. There are several images from Trotter\'s 1957 safari with Alan Moorehead, other images from which can be found in 2001/090/1/3/9, and also images taken in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, during the Queen Mother\'s 1959 visit. There are also pictures of elephants looked after by David Sheldrick (Founder Warden of Tsavo National Park), scenes on the Carr-Hartleys\' farm still owned by their descendants today and also images of baby animals (lion and cheetah) reared by John Seago, who captured, reared and exported animals to zoos in the USA. 

Part 6, contained in a file, consists of a number of aerial views which have possibly become displaced from the box of aerial views prints at 2001/090/1/3/4, or from another part of the collection. They include images taken from aeroplanes of Mt. Longonot, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Lake Naivasha, a Kikuyu reserve, the Rift Valley, the Kenya Coast and Malindi, the Ngong Hills, a Kenya Regiment camp and photos taken during an air patrol over the visit to Kenya of Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton in 1952, to discuss the Mau Mau crisis.', '1951 - 1961', 'default', '4 boxes', '972  b/w photographs, all bearing Trotter\'s stamp on reverse and many also bearing a negative number and Trotter\'s manuscript captions.

Images of the Turkana tribe at Wamba feature portraits of their chiefs. There are also a number of photographs taken on board a dhow in Mombasa Harbour, and a shot of the Kilifi ferry. Some of these images, including entertainments such as local dancers, were taken on safari trips.  

There are also a large number of images taken at large-scale events, including dancers and drummers at the 1952 and 1956 Royal Shows, the 1955 Concours d\' Elegance and the 1955 Kampala Trade Show. Numerous images also date from the visit of Princess Margaret to Kenya in 1956. These include a group of Turkana waving union flags as they wait for her to arrive, and her visits to Machakos where she was entertained by Wakamba dancers and Amboseli where she met members of the Masai tribe.

There are also a small number of images relating to the 1953 Mau Mau uprising. These include shots of a cleansing ceremony, and a man painting the family name on the roof of his house, a common practice.

A number of images included in this section are undated and carry no negative number. At least a proportion of these were taken in the Belgian Congo and feature portraits of local people, described as "pygmies" by Trotter, in small groups or engaged in activities such as hunting and various trades.

The most notable of these is the visit of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to Kenya in early 1959: images taken at this time include groups meeting the Queen in Nairobi\'s Mitchell Park and at Narok, the Royal Agricultural Society of Kenya Show at Eldoret, tribesmen at Kamasia Stadium, Indian dancers at Nairobi City Park, images taken from the Royal train as it passed crowds massed at Sabatia station, Acholi dancers at Murchison Falls Park, a guard of honour at Kampala and a demonstration by Kabaka drummers.

It was during this visit that her father, King George VI died, and she cut short the trip to return home. 

Trotter evidently had permission to attend events during the trip in an official capacity, as the majority of the images are close-ups and taken from vantage points which would have been inaccessible to mere onlookers. The pictures include a small number of images showing preparations for the royal visit around Nairobi, then a number of the Royal party arriving at Eastleigh Airport and greeting the assembled crowds. There follow a number of pictures taken at a garden party in the grounds of Government House, images from a royal tour of the King George VI Hospital and pictures of the Duke of Edinburgh visiting the Kenya Regiment HQ. There are images from a reception at Nairobi\'s City Hall, the last to feature the Royal couple themselves. The final images in the album are all of Sagana Lodge, gifted to the Princess by the people of Kenya, and where she was due to spend a holiday when she received the news about her father. Instead there is an image of the press conference where the news was broken to journalists, followed by images of the outside of Nairobi Cathedral during a memorial service for the King.

Particularly considering these pictures were taken fairly early in Trotter\'s photographic career, they include some impressive images of the young Princess in iconic settings such as on the steps of the BOAC aircraft which took her to Kenya, and possibly paved the way for some of Trotter\'s later commissions.

It was only in use for a short time before Mau Mau activities in the mid 1950s rendered the course unsafe. It was also the impetus for the 1953 inauguration of the East African Safari Rally, when Cecil\'s cousin Neil Vincent declared, with reference to the new circuit, that it was too boring to drive round and round a track!

Trotter\'s album of 1952 photographs must capture one of relatively few races to be held at Langa-Langa. The images show cars and workers at the service pit, the starting grid for various car and motorbike races and many photographs of individual cars/ bikes and their drivers. There are also several shots of spectators around the perimeter and on the bends. 

Motorsport was one of Trotter\'s passions, and he photographed many competitions, including the East African Safari Rally over several years.

As with the photographs of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 2001/090/1/4/1, it is clear that Trotter was allowed considerable access during the visit, and took many photographs at close quarters.

There are a number of pictures taken inside the gardens of Government House, Nairobi, with Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Sir Evelyn and Lady Mary Baring, the Governor of Kenya and his wife. She is also pictured with them at a state reception. There are images of her boarding the Royal train which carried her around Kenya, arriving at Entebbe Airport and in her official car. She is shown making official visits in Nakuru, Aberdare National Park, the Eldoret Show, Baraza and Nakivubu Stadium and inspecting a Police guard of honour at Narok. A number of the images show her being presented with gifts or being cheered by wellwishers.

After a break for war service he returned to the colony, where he later met Margaret Duncan. She was a post office clerk from Scotland, who had travelled to Africa to work in 1918. James and Margaret married in October 1921, and their son Charles was born in 1923. They stayed in Uganda until 1931, when they transferred to Nigeria. There is no evidence of their movements after this, when they possibly returned to the UK.

The material in this section gives a remarkably full insight into the lives of a young couple at this stage in colonial history. Margaret\'s diary, together with her early photograph albums, reflects the exuberance and adventure which led young people to travel to the colonies, and the comparative freedom which young women could enjoy there. The later albums and loose prints give a similar insight into family life in East Africa, with the frequent social events for the British community and trips home to the UK set alongside the nomadic lifestyle associated with James Trotter\'s work as a surveyor. Through the diary and photo captions it is mainly Margaret\'s voice which emerges, in contrast to many of the more official records of colonial life which are primarily concerned with the careers of men.

Also contained with these images are photographs from James Trotter\'s mother Anna, who was brought up in the Caribbean in the 1870s.

There are images of MD herself, colleagues and other British acquaintances including soldiers at the Post Office Bungalow in Nairobi and at social occasions including tea parties, tennis matches, and plays. There are also photographs of her room inside the Post Office Bungalow, the P.O. Instrument Room on Christmas Day 1918 and the hospital where she was admitted in June 1918. After her convalesence she was posted to Ruiru to undertake slightly easier duties, and this section of the album contains a number of images of the local Kikuyu people and their way of life as well as shots of MD\'s friends, social life and living quarters similar to those found elsewhere in the album. Of particular note are a photograph of an "Ngoma" between Kenyan Askaris and German PoWs from a local camp, an image of the King\'s African Rifles leaving Nairobi Station for the front and a group of MD\'s male friends lined up at Ruiru Falls.

In February 1919, MD and her colleague Nell were transferred to Uganda after a farewell picnic at the Post Office Bungalow. There are several images taken on the journey there and a shot of Kampala Cathedral under construction. The Uganda images again show MD\'s companions, home and numerous social occasions, as well as African Post Office workers and people from the Nubian tribe. There are also several pages of images of peace celebrations in Kampala in August 1919, when the Governor Sir Robert Coryndon presided over several days of parades and sports. Later images show Coryndon on an official visit to Entebbe, meeting local officials and crowds. MD\'s diary finishes in 1919, but a number of the photographs after this date are taken in Entebbe, including some of the Entebbe Post Office, suggesting that she was possibly working there for a time. These include images of the mail from Britain being unloaded from a mule cart. Other photographs include scenes around Lake Victoria incuding local people and a hippo shoot, the Entebbe football team and a farewell tea party given by the Indian Community for Sir William Morris Carter, Chief Justice.
