There are photographs of the interior and exterior of his house in Kismayu, Somalia, and of his shamba in Nairobi. There are also images of fellow Europeans in both Somalia and Kenya, some of them colleagues from the Police or King\'s African Rifles. There are several sections of the album showing the "Police lines" (HQ) in Somalia where Elliott worked, and group photographs of the Somalian police troops for whom he was responsible. A number of the images are taken in Kenya, and again show police work and group shots. A section of photographs depict police troops en route for the Anglo-Somali war, or so-called "Mad Mullah campaign."

There are numerous images of the Somali countryside, particularly around the River Juba, showing police on their manouevres but also glimpses of local people, including an Ogaden Chief, and their customs. The album also contains a number of "tourist" shots, featuring Lamu, Aden, Port Said and Suez. A section towards the end of the album contains a number of hunting photographs taken on safari.

The photographs are not dated, and do not appear to have been inserted in chronological order as sections depicting the same events or subjects have in several cases been split.

R. Elliott, former headmaster of Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Gainsborough where Elliott was a pupil. He fought in the Boer War as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment. In 1907 he joined the East Africa Police and in 1908 was made District Superintendent of Police for Jubaland, British East Africa (now Somalia). In 1913 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society for his research on Jubaland. On the outbreak of WW1, Elliott rejoined the Lincolnshire Regiment, attached to the King\'s African Rifles. He worked as an intelligence officer against the Marehan Somalis, and was mentioned in despatches. In 1915 Elliott saw action on the border with German East Africa as a temporary Captain in the K.A.R. and on his return was made District Commissioner of Jubaland. Owing to K.A.R. regular troops being deployed elsewhere in East Africa as the war waged on, the defence of Jubaland was left to African police troops working under Elliott. He was killed alongside a number of his men at Serenli on the Juba River on 2nd February 1916, aged 35, during an attack on his station by hostile Somalis, and was buried at Bardera.

This collection contains Elliott\'s photograph album detailing his life in Kenya and Somalia before WW1, a folder of his letters home, his book "Jubaland and its Inhabitants", a pamphlet describing his war grave and a 1908 map of Jubaland used during the course of his Police work.
