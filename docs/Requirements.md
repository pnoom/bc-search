# Requirements

## Stakeholders

* Users of the Archives: both laypeople and professionals. They want to find
  the information they are looking for as quickly and easily as possible. To
  clarify their exact needs (e.g. by which criteria they would most like to be
  able to search), we are conducting a survey of Archive users.
* Archives staff: they want to improve the accessibility of their collections,
  and need software infrastructure that eases their job as maintainers and
  digitizers. This we know from speaking to them directly.
* We, the developers have an interest in delivering a product that meets the
  needs of the client, their colleagues and users.
* In our opinion it is in the public interest to document and make accessible
  information about local and national history, so the general public is also
  an interested party.

The diagram below reflects the current use cases of the Archives:

Our goal is to remove obstacles and conflicting alternatives on the users' path
to the artifacts they need, as illustrated below:

(TODO: add simplified diagram)

## Use case goals (TODO: make table)

-Layperson wants to find images of Castle Street before the war, to see their
 ancestors' house that was bombed.
 Archives search -> Ref. no -> on-site -> MM
-Researcher wants to find media relating to the social impact on the local
 population of the British Empire's colonisation of Kenya.
 BECC search online -> irrelevant images of Kenya, then BECC navigation -> Slow
 -> Relevant-sounding video (ref. no) -> On-site -> MM
-Archive member wants to add a scanned photograph of SS Great Britain to the
 local maritime history collection. Flowchart?

One goal of particular interest/paramount importance is... Its functional and
non-function requirements are, respectively...
