With a break for war service, James had been with the same department in Uganda since graduating from Cambridge in 1912. Margaret (nee Duncan) had gone out to Kenya as a Post Office clerk in 1918, and was later transferred to Entebbe, where she met James. They were married in 1921.

For the first 6 years of his life, Charles accompanied his parents on a near-permanent safari owing to the itinerant nature of his father's work. The family mixed almost exclusively within the British colonial community where they enjoyed a busy social life, captured by Margaret who was a keen photographer. In 1929 he returned to the UK to attend boarding school, before becoming a professional photographer. He returned to East Africa on the SS Kenya's maiden voyage in 1951 at the age of 28, capturing life on board ship as the first assignment of this phase of his career. He made Nairobi his home for the following 11 years, during which he established himself as a leading photographer of British-Kenyan high society, royal and ceremonial events, industry, safari, sporting fixtures and landscapes, travelling extensively around East Africa. One of his great passions was motorsport, and he was for some years the official photographer of the East African Safari Rally. He also photographed numerous celebrities, including singers and Hollywood actors, who travelled to Kenya, as well as Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their tour of Kenya in 1952.

Charles Trotter represented Kenya in pistol shooting at the Olympics in both 1956 and 1960. In 1962, a year before independence, he returned to the UK, where he died in 2003. He had recorded an oral history interview with the Museum in 2002 (no. 948).

The material in this collection divides into two main series: work created by Charles Trotter during his photographic career (1948 - 1962) and photographs taken by his parents (predominantly his mother Margaret) prior to 1937 when the family are believed to have returned to the UK. Charles's collection of c. 50,000 negatives are a particularly rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to independence - its landscapes, cities, people, society and industries.  Although currently in a poor state of conservation, many of the images are accessible through the large number of prints which form part of this collection. 

The Trotter family photographs form a fascinating contrast by encapsulating life for a British family in East Africa a generation earlier. They give a particular insight into the opportunities and lifestyle available to Margaret Trotter as a young woman in Africa, and the existence of many of her negatives as well as album prints would enable further study into her recording of this part of her life.

There are a number of pictures taken inside the gardens of Government House, Nairobi, with Queen Elizabeth accompanied by Sir Evelyn and Lady Mary Baring, the Governor of Kenya and his wife. She is also pictured with them at a state reception. There are images of her boarding the Royal train which carried her around Kenya, arriving at Entebbe Airport and in her official car. She is shown making official visits in Nakuru, Aberdare National Park, the Eldoret Show, Baraza and Nakivubu Stadium and inspecting a Police guard of honour at Narok.
