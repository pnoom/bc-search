# Domain and design models

Here are some preliminary graphs representing the domain model (problem space)
and design model (solution space), as discussed so far in the SPE lab
sessions. These should be continually updated to reflect changes in our
understanding of the problem and solution.

The graphs were made using Graphviz, which I've just started learning. Feel
free to take a look at the .gv files from which the images are produced.
