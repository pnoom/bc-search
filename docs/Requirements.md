# Requirements

## Stakeholders

* Researchers: Proffesionals who need to quickly and accurately access key data from the archives that is relevant to their job.
* Public User: Members of the general public with an interest in the contents of the archive. Their use of the system is more casual than researchers but still has similar requirements.
* Archives staff: Staff at the archive want to improve the accessibility of their collections,
  and need software infrastructure that eases their job as maintainers and
  digitizers. This we know from speaking to them directly.
* We, the developers have an interest in delivering a product, that meets the
  needs of the client and users, whilst developing our skills and understanding of complex real world systems.
* In our opinion it is in the public interest to document and make accessible
  information about local and national history, so the general public is also
  an interested party.
* Bristol City Council/Bristol Museums: As the funders of Bristol Archives their goals are to make history more accesible via an improved system and to have a more efficient system that would result in reduced costs.

## Use cases

The diagram below reflects the current use cases of the Archives:

Our goal is to remove obstacles and conflicting alternatives on the users' path
to the artifacts they need, as illustrated below:

Below are some illustrative scenarios for the current system:

Scenario | Current path to goal | Desired path to goal
---------|----------------------|----------------------
A layperson wants to find images of Castle Street before the war, to see their ancestors' house that was bombed. | Archives search &rightarrow; Ref. no &rightarrow; on-site &rightarrow; multimedia machine | On-site &rightarrow; quick search using our web app &rightarrow; directly view media
A researcher wants to find media relating to the social impact on the local population of the British Empire's colonisation of Kenya. | BECC search online &rightarrow; irrelevant images of Kenya, then BECC navigation &rightarrow; Slow &rightarrow; Relevant-sounding video (ref. no) &rightarrow; On-site &rightarrow; multimedia machine | On-site &rightarrow; advanced search by location and date using our web app &rightarrow; directly view media
