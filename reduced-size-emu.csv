2002/133,Bristol Record Office,British Empire & Commonwealth,East African Railways & Harbours,,East African Railways & Harbours collection,1 box,,,,"The East African Railways & Harbours Corporation operated railways and harbours in Kenya, Tanzania & Uganda. It was established in 1948 for the new East African High Commission by merging the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours with the Tanganyika Railway. As well as this, the company also ran inland shipping services on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, Lake Albert, the Victoria Nile and the Albert Nile. The company was finally dissolved in 1977 after the High Commission's would-be successor, the East African Community, collapsed because of political discrepancies between the governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Following this, the East Africa Rail network was broken up into three national railways: Tanzania Railways Limited, Kenya Railways Corporation and Uganda Railways Corporation. The collection, which contains paper archives as well as photographs, was deposited by the editor of the EAR&H pensioners' newsletter ‘The Link’, who obtained the material from other former employees. The photographs are currently the only part of the collection which are catalogued and available for research; further records are scheduled to be added over the course of the next year. These photographs, mainly originating in the EAR&H Publicity Department, include opening ceremonies for new train lines, royal and official visits, trade shows, railway workshops and topographic images of EAR&H buildings. They were taken by EAR&H official photographers as a record, and for the company’s editorial and promotional uses.

2005/010,Bristol Record Office,British Empire & Commonwealth,Morey,,Morey collection,"19 volumes, 13 files",,,19 volumes and 13 files,"Geoffrey Morey was an ENT surgeon at Lincoln County Hospital and a keen photographer. With his wife Yvonne, he spent his 6 weeks annual leave each year employed by international companies or organisations to take films and photographs of their overseas operations. This was common in the days before such organisations had photographers on the staff. Morey had seen service in both WW1 and WW2, and visited over 116 countries. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society, the Royal Zoological Society and the Royal Society of Medicine, and had a special expertise in Australian animals. He began making colour films as soon as the technology was available, and already by the 1960s stated on his resume that he had 32 years experience of filming in colour. Although there are fewer available details about Yvonne Morey, she was clearly a talented photographer who received commissions in her own right, and approximately half the photographs in this collection were taken by her. This collection contains a mixture of photograph albums and loose prints taken by the Moreys between 1920 - 1969, mainly 1958-1969. The photographs cover large areas of the Commonwealth, including Australia and the Pacific, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. They feature scenery, wildlife, places of interest, local people and customs. Approximately half the album photos were taken by Geoffrey and half by Yvonne. Many of them were commissioned by tourist offices in the countries represented, and the Moreys passion for travel and exploration of other cultures is clear throughout the collection. This catalogue was produced with support from the National Cataloguing Grants Programme for Archives",,1920-1969,,,,,,,,,,
