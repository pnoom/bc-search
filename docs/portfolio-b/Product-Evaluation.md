# Evaluation

To evaluate our product we decided an interview type meeting with our client would be best in assessing whether we had developed a product that met the clients requirements, asking them questions while they tested our product, navigating our web application, using the different features that do not require much explanation on how to use. These features included the simple search and advanced search, as these are features that we knew the client would be familiar with as they have seen these features be developed over the course of time we have worked with them. We were also familiar with these interview type meetings as we had structured our interactions with our client this way throughout the year, providing us with detailed information enabling us to further develop the product effectively, therefore as we deemed this method successful we chose to evaluate our product this way.
