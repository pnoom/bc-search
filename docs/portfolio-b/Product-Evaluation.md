# Evaluation

To evaluate our product we decided an interview type meeting with our client, A Bristol culture employee for the council, would be best in assessing whether we had developed a product that met the clients requirements, asking them questions while they tested our product, navigating our web application, using the different features that do not require much explanation on how to use. These features included the simple search and advanced search, as these are features that we knew the client would be familiar with as they have seen these features be developed over the course of time we have worked with them. We were also familiar with these interview type meetings as we had structured our interactions with our client this way throughout the year, providing us with detailed information enabling us to further develop the product effectively, therefore as we deemed this method successful we chose to evaluate our product this way.

While they used the simple search and advanced search features we asked them questions such as: "Does it feel responsive, do you feel that it is faster to search the database?" to which they responded "Yes, a lot faster, compared to our other system, you've seen how slow it is, taking 10-15 minutes to return a result so your product taking a few seconds is great." We noted these responses down to ensure we knew what we had done correctly and what needed slight adjusting. After 15 minutes of questioning the user while they used these features, we took back control of the product as we wanted to show the client the upload csv functionality that they would not understand without an explanation, something we will provide a manual for, ensuring that it is used correctly.
