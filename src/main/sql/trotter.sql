With a break for war service, James had been with the same department in Uganda since graduating from Cambridge in 1912. Margaret (nee Duncan) had gone out to Kenya as a Post Office clerk in 1918, and was later transferred to Entebbe, where she met James. They were married in 1921.

For the first 6 years of his life, Charles accompanied his parents on a near-permanent safari owing to the itinerant nature of his father\'s work. The family mixed almost exclusively within the British colonial community where they enjoyed a busy social life, captured by Margaret who was a keen photographer. In 1929 he returned to the UK to attend boarding school, before becoming a professional photographer. He returned to East Africa on the SS Kenya\'s maiden voyage in 1951 at the age of 28, capturing life on board ship as the first assignment of this phase of his career. He made Nairobi his home for the following 11 years, during which he established himself as a leading photographer of British-Kenyan high society, royal and ceremonial events, industry, safari, sporting fixtures and landscapes, travelling extensively around East Africa. One of his great passions was motorsport, and he was for some years the official photographer of the East African Safari Rally. He also photographed numerous celebrities, including singers and Hollywood actors, who travelled to Kenya, as well as Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their tour of Kenya in 1952.

Charles Trotter represented Kenya in pistol shooting at the Olympics in both 1956 and 1960. In 1962, a year before independence, he returned to the UK, where he died in 2003. He had recorded an oral history interview with the Museum in 2002 (no. 948).

The material in this collection divides into two main series: work created by Charles Trotter during his photographic career (1948 - 1962) and photographs taken by his parents (predominantly his mother Margaret) prior to 1937 when the family are believed to have returned to the UK. Charles\'s collection of c. 50,000 negatives are a particularly rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to independence - its landscapes, cities, people, society and industries.  Although currently in a poor state of conservation, many of the images are accessible through the large number of prints which form part of this collection. 

The Trotter family photographs form a fascinating contrast by encapsulating life for a British family in East Africa a generation earlier. They give a particular insight into the opportunities and lifestyle available to Margaret Trotter as a young woman in Africa, and the existence of many of her negatives as well as album prints would enable further study into her recording of this part of her life.

Based in Nairobi, his work covered a huge variety of subjects for which he received commissions, such as weddings, family portraits and society occasions (chiefly among the British community), commercial commissions showing industries of the time, and public occasions such as sporting and cultural events and royal visits. There are also a huge number of images which represent his own interests, including African landscapes and wildlife and local people. The majority of the images are taken in Kenya, although other East African countries including Zanzibar, Tanzania and Uganda are also represented. His reputation is demonstrated by his presence behind the scenes at royal visits and on the sets of Hollywood films. The particular research value of the collection lies in the fact that many of the pictures capture the end of Kenya as a colony, and the new roads, civic buildings and factories photographed by Trotter suggest the pride which accompanied independence.

Areas of particular focus and interest include:
 - motorsport, with images from the East African Safari Rally for which Trotter was the official photographer
 - other sporting events, including horse shows, athletics meets and the Kenyan Team at the Melbourne (1956) and Rome (1960) Olympics
- the 1950s expansion of Nairobi, with its large number of new buildings constructed in an attempt to represent a departure from its colonial origins
 - aerial photography of the Kenyan landscape
 - film stills and film stars visiting Kenya on location, including Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable
 - royal visits, including Princess Elizabeth on the visit where she became Queen in 1952 and the Queen Mother in 1959
 - scenes connected to the Mau Mau emergency

The material in this collection includes the complete set of over 50,000 negatives from Trotter\'s career, together with complete indexes to the images. There are also over 2000 loose prints, 3 albums and c. 150 enlargements taken from the negative collection, as well as c. 330 slides and a film for which Trotter was cameraman.', '1948 - 1962', 'default', '51 boxes, 1 film', 'default', 'default', 6);
