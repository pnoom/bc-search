# Requirements

## Stakeholders

* Users of the Archives: both laypeople and professionals. They want to find
  the information they are looking for as quickly and easily as possible. To
  clarify their exact needs (e.g. by which criteria they would most like to be
  able to search), we are conducting a survey of Archive users.
* Archives staff: they want to improve the accessibility of their collections,
  and need software infrastructure that eases their job as maintainers and
  digitizers. This we know from speaking to them directly.
* We, the developers have an interest in delivering a product that meets the
  needs of the client, their colleagues and users.
* In our opinion it is in the public interest to document and make accessible
  information about local and national history, so the general public is also
  an interested party.

## Use cases

The diagram below reflects the current use cases of the Archives:

Our goal is to remove obstacles and conflicting alternatives on the users' path
to the artifacts they need, as illustrated below:

Below are some illustrative scenarios:

Scenario | Current path to goal | Desired path to goal
---------|----------------------|----------------------
A layperson wants to find images of Castle Street before the war, to see their ancestors' house that was bombed. | Archives search -> Ref. no -> on-site -> multimedia machine | On-site -> quick search using our web app &rightarrow; directly view media
A researcher wants to find media relating to the social impact on the local population of the British Empire's colonisation of Kenya. | BECC search online -> irrelevant images of Kenya, then BECC navigation -> Slow -> Relevant-sounding video (ref. no) -> On-site -> multimedia machine | On-site -> advanced search by location and date using our web app -> directly view media
